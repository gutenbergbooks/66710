<h4 id='ch1' class='c015'>CHAP. I. <br /><i>Consequences of imposing the Price of Coinage, and the Duty of Seignorage upon the Coin of a Nation, so far as they affect the Price of Bullion, and that of all other Commodities.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>The political oeconomy of modern states is so involved with
the interests of commerce, that it is necessary at every step
we make, to keep in our eye the combinations which arise from
that quarter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever tends to simplify an intricate theory, greatly assists the
mind: dividing this book into two parts, seems, as it were, dividing
the burden it has to carry: the principles already deduced may there
ripen by a short pause, and the analogy of the matter which is to
follow in the second part, where new combinations are taken in,
will recall them to the mind and fix them in the memory.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.1'></a>Intricacy of this subject.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>I am now to examine one of the nicest principles in the whole
doctrine of money, to wit, the effects of imposing the price of coinage,
and the duty of seignorage upon coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>When this question is considered in relation to all the combinations
which arise, 1. from the nature of coin considered as a metal,
and at the same time as a money of accompt; 2. from the influence
this duty has upon the price of commodities; and 3. from the imposition
<a id='corr2.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='of'>as</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_2.8'><ins class='correction' title='of'>as</ins></a></span> affecting, <em>directly</em>, the nation which lays it on, and all
other nations trading with it <em>occasionally</em>: when all these combinations
are taken together, I say nothing will be found more difficult
than to reduce this question to a distinct theory.</p>

<p class='c001'>What I have to say upon it has found a place in this inquiry, rather
with a view to suggest ideas to men of a better capacity, than
from the hopes of satisfying my readers in every particular.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.2'></a>Recapitulation of some principles.</div>

<p class='c001'>I have said, that gold and silver are commodities merely like
every other thing. I have shewn the utter impossibility of their
being a scale, or an invariable measure of value. I have observed
that their being made into coin (<em>among trading nations</em>) has not the
effect of rendring them less a commodity than they were before,
except so far, as by that operation every piece, instead of
being valued by its own weight, comes to be in the mean proportion
of all the pieces which compose the currency: and I have shewn
how the operations of trade are capable to sift out and establish this
mean proportion, in spite of very great irregularities. These are
the principles laid down in the first part, which we must keep in
our eye while we examine the question.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since gold and silver, then, are commodities like every other
thing, the invariable scale of value must measure <em>them</em> as well as
every other commodity, and money of accompt must be considered
in no other light, than as a scale for expressing the proportional
value of grains of metals, yards of stuffs, pounds of wares, bushels
of grain, or gallons of liquors. In this view, when we mention a
hundred pounds, it is just as proper to consider this value relatively to
the measure of any merchandize, as to the metalic measure of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>coin. Every merchandize, when considered by itself, should be
measured by its own measure, gold by grains, liquors by gallons,
wheat by bushels, &amp;c. The denominations of pounds, shillings,
and pence, are only necessary for reducing all other sorts of weights
and measures to an equation of value. This is what is understood
by the universal scale of proportional value. I think this idea is
sufficiently clear.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.3'></a>The first introduction of coinage must make prices fall.</div>

<p class='c001'>Let us now suppose a country where the invention of coin is not
known, and where a yard of cloth of a certain quality, is commonly
sold for 100 grains of either silver or gold, no matter which.
The state falls upon the invention of coining, the conveniency of
which every body understands. This coinage, I suppose, costs
2 <i>per cent.</i> Coin is introduced, and commodities are ordered to be
bought with it. I ask, what effect ought this revolution to produce
upon the price of the cloth, according to strict theory, and without
taking in any other combination of circumstances? I answer,
that the cloth ought in reason to fall 2 <i>per cent.</i> that is, that the
price of a yard ought to be a coin of 98 grains. Here is the reason:
He who formerly had the 100 grains, had the value of the yard of
cloth, and could change the one for the other when he would.
Now he has the 100 grains, but he must give two grains to have it
coined, before he can buy; because after this invention people will
not trust to the weighing of private people, nor to the purity of the
metals; but they will believe, upon the authority of the stamp,
that in every piece a certain number of grains of the fine metal is
contained. He, therefore, who has a coin of 98 grains, comes to
the merchant, and offers him his coin for his yard of cloth; the
merchant demands a coin of 100 grains, says the other, these 98
grains which I give you in coin, cost me two grains to have their
weight and fineness ascertained; and if you refuse to repay me for
what I have paid for this manufacture which I offer you for your
cloth, I may with equal reason refuse to pay you for what you paid
for weaving your wool into cloth. Now since I, in buying your
cloth, must pay the weaver, so you, in buying my piece, must pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the mint. The merchant, convinced by this reasoning, takes the
piece, and as it circulates from hand to hand, every commodity
given in exchange for it, must fall 2 <i>per cent.</i> relatively to the
grains of metal it was worth before.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.4'></a>Consequences of the exclusive privilege of coinage.</div>

<p class='c001'>Farther, if by the laws and customs of a country, coin is absolutely
necessary for buying and selling, this coin must be had; and
if there be but one person who can make it, the price he thinks fit
to demand for it is the only measure of the value of fabrication.
The grains of the metals, therefore, in the coin, must rise in their
proportional value to yards of cloth, and to gallons of liquor, in
proportion to the cost of coinage, as the pounds of wool and silk
must rise in their value in proportion to their manufacture.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this it follows, that since the value of coin must rise in proportion
to every commodity, it must also rise with respect to the
metals it is made of, just as wool manufactured rises with respect
to wool which is not manufactured.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now let us suppose that a Prince finding that he has the exclusive
privilege of making coin, shall raise his price of coinage to 8 <i>per
cent.</i> what will the consequence be?</p>

<p class='c001'>The first consequence of this will be to destroy, or at least to perplex
the ideas of his subjects with regard to coin, and to make them
believe, that it is the stamp, and not the metal which constitutes
the value of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next consequence will be, to reduce the price of the yard of
cloth, which was worth 100 grains of metal before the invention
of coinage, from 98, where it stood, to 92. Now let us suppose that
this country, which we shall call (F), is in the neighbourhood of
another which we shall call (E), where there is both cloth of the
same quality, and coin of the same weight and fineness, which
costs nothing for the coinage. In the country (E), <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cæteris paribus</i></span>,
the yard of cloth must be sold for 100 grains, as it sold formerly in
the country (F) before the coinage was imposed. If the country
(F) wants the cloth of the country (E), the cloth they demand must
cost (F) 100 grains the yard. If the country (E) wants the cloth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of the country (F), this cloth will also cost 100 grains; because to
procure a coin of 92 grains of the country (F), (E) must pay 8 grains
for the coinage, which raises the price of the cloth to 100 grains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.5'></a>A wrong balance of trade raises the price of bullion to the value of coin,</div>

<p class='c001'>Let us now suppose, that for a certain time the country (F) has
absolute occasion for the cloth of the country (E). The merchants
of (F) who carry on this trade, must send bullion to (E) to pay for
this cloth. But the merchants of the country (F) who deal in bullion,
perceiving the usefulness of it for this trade, will then raise
the price of the 100 grains of it above the 92 grains in coin (the
common market price of bullion before this trade was known) and
according to the demand made for the foreign cloth, the bullion
will rise in the country (F), until 100 grains of it become
exactly worth 100 grains in coin. The bullion can never rise
higher; because at that period, the coin itself will be exported for
bullion; and the country of (E) will accept of 100 grains in their
coin as willingly as in any other form. Nor will it ever fall lower
than 92 grains; because the mint in the country (F) is always ready
to give that price for all the bullion which is brought to be coined.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here then is a case, where the coin is made to lose all its advanced
price as a manufacture, and this is owing entirely to its
being a metal as well as a money of accompt.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now as the coin has lost this additional value, by a circumstance
purely relative to itself as a metal, there is no reason why other merchandize
should sink in value along with it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.6'></a>and ought to raise proportionally the price of commodities.</div>

<p class='c001'>The consequence, therefore, of this revolution ought to be, that
as the merchandize, <em>bullion</em>, has got up 8 <i>per cent.</i> with regard to the
coin, and as the price of all merchandize ought to be in proportion
to the grains of bullion to which that price amounts, the revolution
having annihilated the 8 <i>per cent.</i> advance upon the coin, ought to
have the same effect with respect to prices as if coinage were given
gratis, as in the country of (E); that is, the yard of cloth ought at
this time to cost, in the country of (F), 100 grains, either of coin or
bullion, since they are of the same value.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Farther, in proportion as this demand for bullion comes to diminish,
that is to say, in proportion as the balance of trade becomes
less unfavourable to the country of (F), in the same proportion will
coin rise in its price, when compared with bullion; and when the
country of (E), in its turn, comes to have occasion for the country
of (F), then (E) must pay as formerly for a yard of cloth 92 grains
in bullion, and the remaining 8 grains to have it coined; in which
case, the yard of cloth will fall to the old price of 92 grains in coin,
and will stand at 100 grains in bullion as before.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did the price of a manufacture rise and fall as has been here represented,
it is plain that these variations would be constantly determined
by the proportion of the grains of the metals it costs to
acquire the coin which is the price of the manufacture.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen that upon the institution of coinage and seigniorage,
the yard of cloth fell to 92 grains; because then it was impossible
to procure coin at a less price than 8 <i>per cent.</i> but when the balance
of trade had sunk the coin to the value of bullion, then the 92 grains
of the <em>coin</em> being to be purchased with 92 grains of <em>bullion</em>, it was
reasonable that the cloth should rise to its former price; because
then no body could say that the coin of 92 grains had cost 100 to
procure it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this theory does not hold in practice, nor can it possibly hold,
as long as the greatest part of a people are ignorant of, and even
do not feel the revolutions we have been here describing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.7'></a>How traders obstruct the operation of these principles, while the balance of trade continues fluctuating,</div>

<p class='c001'>The price of bullion is entirely regulated by merchants, who have
the whole correspondence in their hands. It rises and falls in
countries where coinage is imposed, in proportion to the state of
the balance of trade at the time. The smallest rise or fall in the
demand for bullion in the market, is immediately marked by the
price of it, and that ought (by the principles we have been laying
down) to regulate the rise and fall of every commodity. But this
is by no means the case. Commodities rise and fall only after a
certain time; and of this interval merchants will constantly profit.
Does the price of bullion rise, they immediately sell to strangers as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>if all prices were immediately risen; but with regard to <a id='corr7.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='manufactures'>manufacturers</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_7.1'><ins class='correction' title='manufactures'>manufacturers</ins></a></span>,
they hide the revolution with great care, and preserve prices
from rising, until the competition among themselves discovers the
secret. Does the price of bullion fall, they do all they can to keep
up the prices of every commodity which they sell to strangers,
until the competition among themselves obliges them to bring them
down; and with regard to manufactures, they are all in one interest
to reduce the prices in proportion to the fall of the bullion, which
works its effects by slow degrees.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.8'></a>and how an overturned balance of trade attaches prices to the denominations of coin.</div>

<p class='c001'>These are the operations of traders, in times when there is a
<em>fluctuation</em> in the balance of the trade of a country; that is to say,
in times when the balance is sometimes favourable and sometimes
not.</p>

<p class='c001'>At such times the true influence which trade ought to have upon
prices is never exactly known, but to the merchants, who seldom
fail to profit of their knowledge, in place of communicating it for
the benefit of the society. But that is not the case when the balance
of trade is quite <em>overturned</em>, that is, when it remains for a long time
against a nation, without any favourable vibration; as we shall
presently explain.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how, by the changes in the balance of trade, the
price of bullion is made susceptible of a variation in its value, equal
to the price of coinage; and we have pointed out the principle
which confines the variation within certain limits; to wit, the value
of the coin as a metal, which prevents bullion from rising
higher; and the mint price, which preserves it from falling lower.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have observed how merchants may profit of such variations,
and how they obstruct the operation of principles upon the rise and
fall of prices. We now proceed to another chain of causes, which
tend greatly to destroy the due proportion of value between coin
and merchandize. This with justice may be put also to the account
of the imperfection of the metals in performing the functions of
money of accompt.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Universal experience shews that the prices of merchandize are so
attached to the denominations of coin, that they do not fluctuate as
principles point out, any more than projectiles describe parabolas,
or that machines operate the effects, which by calculation they
ought to do. The resistance of the air in one case, the friction of
the parts in the other, tend to render theory incorrect. Just so here,
our theory represents prices as rising and sinking in the most harmonious
proportion together with the metals; but in practice it is
not so. They have their frictions and political resistances, which
only render the theory delusive when every circumstance is not
combined. A good gunner must calculate the resistance of the air
upon his bomb, or he never will hit the mark.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have already shewn how the interests of mercantile people
tend to obstruct the due fluctuation of prices; we must now take in
other combinations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although this be not a proper place to resume a discussion of the
particular theory of the rise and fall of prices, yet still something
must be said upon that subject, in order to bring the question we
are upon to some sort of solution.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.9'></a>How profits consolidate into prime cost,</div>

<p class='c001'>First then, it will be agreed that it is far easier to make a price
rise, than to make it fall. I believe I might take this for granted,
without giving the reason for it. At all times, a price which has
long stood low, may be made to rise; but it is next to impossible to
make a price which has long stood high, to fall in the same manner.
Here is the reason: Let me suppose the yard of an extensive
manufacture which occupies a number of hands, to be worth 100
grains. The workmen here live nearly at the same expence, and I
suppose them to live upon the profits of their work, when they sell
at 100 grains a yard. The price rises to 120; here is an additional profit
of 20 grains. If a sudden turn should diminish the demand which
raised the price of the merchandize, it will fall to the old rate without
much difficulty; the workmen will consider the 20 grains addition
as a precarious profit upon which they cannot reckon: but
let the price of 120 grains remain uniformly for some years, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>20 grains will cease to be precarious profits; they will consolidate,
as we have called it, into the value of the merchandize; because
the workmen, by having long enjoyed them, will have bettered
their way of living; and as they are many, and live uniformly,
any thing which obliges them to retrench a part of their habitual
expence, is supposed to deprive them of necessaries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.10'></a>and are preserved upon articles of home consumption,</div>

<p class='c001'>This is sufficient, as a hint, upon a subject which branches out
into an infinity of different relations, not at all to the present purpose.
But it is very much to the purpose to shew how the imposition
of coinage must, on many occasions, have the effect of attaching
the price of commodities to the denominations of the coin,
instead of preserving them attached to the grains of the metals
which compose them, as in theory they ought to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>When wars, <i>e. g.</i> occasion a wrong balance to continue for many
years against a nation, this keeps coin at par with bullion for a
long time. Is it not very natural, that during that time manufacturers
should estimate their work according to the coin, and not as
formerly, according to the bullion? The consequence of this is,
that when peace returns, and when coin begins to rise above
the price of bullion, the manufacturers stick to the denominations
of the coin, instead of descending in value (as they ought to do by
theory) along with the bullion. What is the consequence of this?
It is that the prices of manufactures <em>for home consumption</em>, and of <em>commodities
peculiar to the country</em>, stand their ground; that is, prices do
not descend, and cannot be brought down by merchants.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.11'></a>but are torn away by foreign competition for articles of exportation.</div>

<p class='c001'>But as to manufactures for exportation, which are not peculiar,
but which are produced by different countries, their prices are
violently pulled down by foreign competition; and the workmen
are forced to diminish them. This hurts them effectually, not because
of the diminution of the prices; because, properly speaking,
this diminution is only relative to the denominations of the coin;
their <a id='corr9.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='grains'>gains</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_9.32'><ins class='correction' title='grains'>gains</ins></a></span> will purchase as many grains of bullion in the market
as before, but not so much coin, and consequently not so much of
any commodity which, by the principles just laid down, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>attached themselves to the denominations of the coin, and have
risen in their price along with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this short exposition of a very intricate matter, we may
conclude, that the imposition of coinage does not raise the price of
such merchandize as is in common to several nations, and which
trade demands from each, without any competition with the natives;
that is to say, the prices of them stand as formerly with
respect to strangers; because although the prices be made to sink
at home, with respect to the denominations of the coin, yet
strangers, being obliged to pay for them in those denominations,
are also obliged to pay an advanced price for the coin, in order to
procure them. This is the price of coinage. This, I confess, is a
little subtil, but I believe the reasoning will be found just.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, when trade extends itself to other commodities,
to those, I mean, which it buys in competition with the
natives (and which are made to rise and fall from the vicissitudes of
inland demand) or to such commodities as are peculiar to the
country; in these cases, I have little doubt but the prices, once
raised and continued high for some time, attach themselves to the
denominations of the coin, and rise along with it; that is to say,
coinage is included over and above the price which the merchandize
would have born had no coinage been imposed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn1.12'></a>How this hurts the industrious, and how the state may indemnify them.</div>

<p class='c001'>The conclusion I draw from this reasoning, is, that the imposition
of coinage has not, in fact, the effect of reducing the prices of
commodities to fewer grains of bullion than before, excepting those
of such commodities as are sold in competition with other nations;
and even then it may be said, that it is not the imposition of the
coinage, but the competition with strangers, which reduces them
to the minimum of their value, as well as the profits of those who
work in them, to the minimum of a physical necessary. This last
circumstance shews why those who work for foreign exportation,
are the poorest class of all the industrious of a state, but the most
useful to it, at the same time. I believe experience supports the
truth of these conclusions. I shall here by the bye observe, that as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the state is made to profit by the diminution of the profits of this
most useful class; as she receives the coinage which strangers
pay, and which is really deducted from the manufacturers who
support exportation, she ought to indemnify this class (as may be
done in a thousand ways, by premiums, for example, upon exportation)
out of the profits arising upon coinage, instead of making
coinage free, to the evident loss of the nation, and benefit to strangers,
as we shall now endeavour to prove.</p>

<h4 id='ch2' class='c015'>CHAP. II. <br /> <i>Concerning the Influence which the imposing the Price of Coinage, and the Duty of Seigniorage in the English Mint, will have upon the Course of Exchange, and Trade of Great Britain.</i></h4>

<div  class='c007'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.1'></a>Theory of prices upon articles of exportation.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the preceding chapter we have examined a very nice theory,
into which such a number of circumstances have been combined,
depending upon facts, that little stress is to be laid upon
several conclusions which have been drawn from it, unless they be
approved by experience.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the best workman in London make a watch, he cannot depend
upon its being a good one, until it be tried; and when that is
done, the application of his theory will enable him to discover all
the defects and irregularities in the movement. It is just so in political
matters. The force of theory is not sufficient to form a good
plan; but it is useful for discovering many faults which would not
have been foreseen without it. The more extensive, therefore, any
theory is made, the more it is useful for these purposes. It is proper
only to observe that the more complicated any principle of it
is, the less dependance can be had upon its operation when applied
to practice.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>It is impossible to lay down a distinct theory for the rise and fall
of the prices of all sorts of commodities in a nation such as Great
Britain. All that can be said with certainty, is, that competition on
the part of the consumers will make them rise, and that competition
on the part of the furnishers will make them fall. Now the
competition among the furnishers may be reduced to theory; because
it is fixed within determinate limits, which it cannot exceed,
and is influenced by this principle, viz. that when profits are reduced
to the minimum (that is to the exact physical-necessary of the
workman) all competition among furnishers must cease.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the competition among consumers is fixed within no determinate
limits: some demand to satisfy physical wants; others those
of vanity and caprice. Most inland demand for consumption is of
this kind, and consequently it is impossible to foresee what effect
the imposition of coinage will have upon the prices of many commodities.
Perhaps they will fluctuate with bullion; perhaps they
will adhere to the denominations of the coin: experience alone
can bring this matter to light.</p>

<p class='c001'>But with regard to such commodities as are the object of foreign
trade, prices are influenced by certain principles on both sides.
Merchants, not the consumers themselves, are the demanders here.
Neither vanity or caprice, but profit, regulates the price they offer.
Thus it is, that as all competition among furnishers must cease upon
the reduction of profits to the minimum, so all demand from merchants
(who in this case represent the consumers) must cease, so
soon as prices rise above what they can afford to give, consistent
with their minimum of profit upon the sale of what they buy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The degree, therefore, of foreign competition will alone regulate
the prices of several exportable commodities, and of consequence
the profits of such as are employed in them, as has been
said. This premised, we come to examine the influence which the
imposition of coinage would have upon the course of exchange and
trade of a nation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.2'></a>How the course of exchange is regulated.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>In speaking of exchange, so far as it influences the decision of
this question, we must throw out all extraneous circumstances, and
endeavour to reduce it to the plainest theory.</p>

<p class='c001'>When one nation pays to another the price of what they buy, the
interposition of bullion is unavoidable; and the whole operation
consists in comparing the value of coin with the value of bullion
in the one and in the other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.3'></a>Price of exchange what?</div>

<p class='c001'>Suppose France to owe to England 1000 pound sterling; what regulates
exchange here, is the price of bullion in Paris and in London.
The French merchant inquires first, what is the quantity of
bullion in London, which at that time is equal to the sum he wants
to pay? And next, what that quantity of bullion costs to procure in
the Paris market? Upon this the par of exchange ought to be regulated.
Whatever is given more than this quantity is the price of
transportation, when the balance of trade is against France. Whatever
is given less, may be considered as the price of transportation
which the English would be obliged to pay were the balance
against England, if the French merchant, by sending his paper to
London, did not save them the trouble, by diminishing so far the
balance against them; and of this he profits, until the balance
turns to the other side. Now let us leave the price of transportation
out of the question, and consider only how the imposition of coinage,
by affecting the price of bullion, may influence the course of
exchange.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.4'></a>Where coinage is free the price of bullion ought to be invariable,</div>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how the imposition of coinage renders the price of
bullion susceptible of a variation in its price, equal to the amount
of the imposition. Wherever, therefore, coinage costs nothing,
there bullion and coin must always be of the same value. This
would be the case in England, without doubt, were the metals in
the coin exactly proportioned, were all the coin of a legal weight,
and were neither melting down, or exporting made penal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.5'></a>and fluctuating where coinage is imposed.</div>

<p class='c001'>The bullion, therefore, in France may vary 8 <i>per cent.</i> in its price,
according to the balance of trade; the bullion in England must be
supposed invariable, let the balance stand as it will.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.6'></a>Bullion in England dearer than in France,</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>According to this representation of the matter, may we not say,
that bullion in England is always at the highest price it ever can be
in France, since it is at the price of the coin? Is not this the condition
of France, when the balance of her trade is the most unfavourable
it possibly can be?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.7'></a>because the price of it is kept up by the mint,</div>

<p class='c001'>If therefore England, <em>herself</em>, contributes to keep the price of her
bullion higher than it is in France, is not this an advantage to
France, since France can buy the bullion with which she pays her
English debts cheap in her own market, and can sell it dear in that
of her creditor? Is there not a profit in buying an ox cheap in the
country, and selling him dear in Smithfield market?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.8'></a>and is allowed to fall in France 8 per cent. below the coin.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now why is bullion sometimes cheaper in France than in England?
I answer, that in France it is allowed to fall 8 <i>per cent.</i> below
the coin, and the King only takes it at times when no body can get
a better price for it: and that in England the King gives always coin
for bullion, and by that keeps the price of it from ever falling
lower. Let the English mint pay the pound troy standard silver at
the rate of thirteen ounces of coin, the price of bullion in England
will always be <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>13</sub> dearer than the coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>When bullion in France falls to 8 <i>per cent.</i> below the coin, it is
carried to the mint: when it is worth more no body carries any to
be coined.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.9'></a>The wise regulation.</div>

<p class='c001'>No body in France (except upon a general coinage) is forced to
sell their bullion at this price. Is it not, therefore, a very wise
regulation, to permit the operations of trade to reduce, as low as
possible, the value of that commodity with which all they owe is
paid, and this more especially, as the fall of its price is a proof of
the prosperity of their trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, it be supposed, that the effect of having a material
money for a scale of value, is, that the denominations in the coin,
and not the grains of the bullion, must measure the value of commodities
<em>for home consumption</em>; then it follows, that the variations in
the price of bullion, should not affect the price of commodities.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>This is a question, however, which I do not pretend to determine,
and I apprehend that nothing but experience can resolve it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.10'></a>England loses by this sometimes 8 per cent. upon her trade with France.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now let me consider the difference there is between the trade of
France and that of England as matters now stand; and what would
be the case, were the regulations of the mint the same in both
countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall suppose that England buys of French goods as much as
may be paid with one thousand pounds troy weight of English guineas.
I ask for what weight of French louis d’ors must France buy
of English goods to make the balance even? Will it not be answered
(according to the ordinary method of calculating the true
par of exchange) that if France buys for one thousand pounds troy
of her louis d’ors (supposing the guineas and the louis d’ors of the
same fineness) that the balance is even?</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not true, that England must send this thousand pounds
weight either in gold bullion or in guineas, and is it not the same
thing to the English merchant to send the one or the other, providing
the guineas be full weight?</p>

<p class='c001'>But when France comes to send the thousand pounds weight of
her louis d’ors, she finds at market a thousand pounds weight of
gold bullion 8 <i>per cent.</i> cheaper, and this bullion is as good to the
Englishman as if he had got the louis d’ors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me state the case otherwise. Suppose France buys in England
for 1000 pounds weight of her guineas in Virginia tobacco; and
that England buys in France for 1000 pounds weight of her
louis d’ors of Bourdeaux claret. Is not this called <a id='corr15.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='par.'>par?</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_15.26'><ins class='correction' title='par.'>par?</ins></a></span> Will not
France pay her debt to England with 1000 pound of gold bullion?
Whereas England must pay 1080 pounds to France; because 1000
pounds weight of her louis d’ors, is worth in France 1080 pounds
of any bullion of the same standard. The 1000 pounds then compensates
the 1000 pounds; the 80 pounds over must be sent to
France, and the carriage of this quantity only, must be paid for
according to the principles of exchange.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Here is evidently a balance of trade against England of 8 <i>per cent.</i>
above the real par of the metals. Will any body say that the 8 <i>per
cent.</i> is paid for the transportation of 80 pounds of bullion due?
Certainly not.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now if the English should declare that they, for the future, would
coin neither gold or silver bullion for any person, but at the rate of
8 <i>per cent.</i> below the value of the coin; and if it be true, that this
regulation would have the effect of linking the price of bullion, on
many occasions, to 8 <i>per cent.</i> below the coin; in that case, would
not the English and the French acquit their debts of the 1000
pounds weight of their respective coin upon the same conditions?
In this case, would not the price of exchange vanish, since there
would be no bullion to be sent by either party? But in the first case,
would not England be obliged to send 8 <i>per cent.</i> above the quantity
of gold bullion she received from France, and would not the
transportation of this cost money, and would not this transportation
be marked by a certain price of exchange, and consequently, would
not the price of exchange rise against England?</p>

<p class='c001'>But to this it is objected, that by the former example, the exchange
marked 8 <i>per cent.</i> against England with great reason; because
it is plain, that there is a balance of 8 <i>per cent.</i> against England,
since she has sent that proportion over to France in bullion.
Very true. But had England, instead of taking to the value of
1000 pounds weight of louis d’ors in claret, taken only for 100
pounds weight, the exchange would have still marked 8 <i>per cent.</i>
loss; because the 100 pounds of louis d’ors must be paid with the
108 pounds of bullion, although England by this trade has evidently
gained 892 pounds of bullion, which France must send her
as a balance.</p>

<p class='c001'>As matters of fact, when they can be procured, tend greatly to
confirm theory, by forming a solid basis whereupon to reason, I
shall here profit of one which has fallen into my hands, and by
applying it to the present question, endeavour to give some additional
force to this reasoning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.11'></a>and at a medium 4 per cent. as is proved by a matter of fact.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Mr. Cantillon, in his <cite>Analysis of Trade</cite>, which I suppose he understood
by practice as well as by theory, has the following passage in
his 99th page.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The course of exchange between Paris and London since the year
1726, has been at a medium price of 32 pence sterling for the
crown of three livres; that is to say, we pay for this French
crown of three livres, 32 pence sterling, <em>when calculated on gold</em>,
when in fact it is worth but thirty pence and three farthings,
which is giving four pounds in the hundred for this French money;
and consequently, upon gold, the balance of trade is 4 <i>per
cent.</i> against England in favour of France.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In this place, Mr. Cantillon calculates the par of exchange according
to the common rule, to wit, gold bullion against gold bullion
in the coins of both nations, where both are of legal weight;
and he finds that there has been, these thirty four years past, a balance
of 4 <i>per cent.</i> against England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now according to my theory, this is exactly what the coinage in
France ought to produce, supposing on an average that the trade
had been at par. Here is the reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>The coinage in France costs 8 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>When the balance of trade is favourable for France, coin is worth
8 <i>per cent.</i> above bullion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proof is plain. Were it not 8 <i>per cent.</i> above bullion, no man
would ever carry bullion to the mint; because the mint price is
8 <i>per cent.</i> below that of the coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the balance of trade is against France, coin must fall nearly
to the price of bullion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Supposing then that the balance of the trade of France (at a medium
of thirty four years) is found to have been at par, will it not
follow, that at a medium also of these thirty four years, French coin
must have been at 4 <i>per cent.</i> (the half of the coinage) above bullion?
Consequently England having taken merchandize from
France, and France having merchandize from England, for the
same weight and fineness in their respective coins, must not England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>have been obliged to send to France 4 <i>per cent.</i> more bullion in
order to pay the coinage? This reasoning appears conclusive to me,
who am no merchant, and who do by no means pretend to a perfect
understanding of those affairs; but I think this circumstance
is at least of sufficient importance to make the matter be inquired
into. For this purpose, I shall suggest a method of making the discovery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.12'></a>Easy to be verified at all times by the price of bullion and course of exchange in the Paris market.</div>

<p class='c001'>If it shall be found, that English draughts on Paris, or French
remittances to England, shall at any time occasion bullion to rise in
the market of Paris above the mint price, will it not be allowed that
such a circumstance demonstrates that the balance of trade is then
in favour of England? If at that same time it shall be found, that
exchange (when reckoned upon the gold as Cantillon has done) is
against England, will it not be a demonstration of the truth of what
I have here suggested as a question worthy of examination?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.13'></a>When bullion is exported to England, exchange is against France.</div>

<p class='c001'>For if the balance of trade be against France, so as to make her
buy bullion to send to England, this is a proof that she owes England
a balance; and if at the same time the English are paying
above the intrinsic value of the metals (in their respective coins) in
what they owe to France, that additional value cannot be paid by
England as the price of exchange, or to pay for the transportation
of their bullion, but to pay the French creditors the additional value
of their coin above the price of bullion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.14'></a>Course of exchange no rule of judging of the balance of trade, but only of the value of coin.</div>

<p class='c001'>May we not also conclude, that in a kingdom such as England,
where coinage is free, the course of exchange is no certain rule for
judging of the balance of trade with France; but only of the value
of French coin above French bullion. All authors who have written
upon exchange, represent the advanced price given upon bills above
the intrinsic value of the coins, to be the price of carriage and insurance,
&amp;c. in which case exchange, no doubt, <em>may</em> mark the balance
of trade; but if an advanced price must be given in order to
put bullion into coin, or in other words, if the metals in the coin
are worth 8 <i>per cent.</i> more than any bullion of the same fineness, is
it not evident that a nation may be drawing a great balance of bullion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>from another, although she be, at the same time, paying
8 <i>per cent.</i> above the rate of bullion in the sums she repays to the
nation which is her debtor upon the whole; that is to say, although
she be paying above the real par of exchange, <em>as it is commonly calculated</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be here objected that this cannot be the case, because when
the balance of trade is against the nation which imposes coinage,
their coin falls to the price of bullion: I answer, that a balance
may be against such a nation, without producing so great a fall in
the coin. Coin is reduced to the par of bullion only when the balance
is at the height against a nation, and when it has remained
so for a long time. Who would give coin at a discount of 8 <i>per cent.</i>
if there was a prospect that in a few days, weeks, or even months,
it was to rise to its former value?</p>

<p class='c001'>These are the reasons which engaged me, in a former chapter,
to lay it down as a rule, that trading states should endeavour, as
nearly as possible, to observe the same regulations with their neighbours,
in every thing relating to their coin. It is also in order to
facilitate such a regulation, that I shall insert, at the end of this
book, a very particular state of the French coinage, and of what I
can gather with regard to that of Holland.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.15'></a>The real par not to be calculated by the intrinsic value of the coin, unless bills were drawn in weight of fine bullion.</div>

<p class='c001'>From what has been said, it appears that the common method of
calculating the real par of exchange is not correct, since it is calculated
by comparing the quantity of fine bullion in different coins,
and attributing the difference between the bullion paid for the paper,
and the bullion received in payment of it, as the price of transportation.
This, I say, is by no means correct; nor is it possible it
should be so, unless bills of exchange were specified in the weight
of fine bullion, instead of being specified in the denominations
of the coin: an example will make this plain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were a merchant in London to ask of another who has a correspondence
in Paris, to give him an order for a hundred yards of
Abbeville cloth, and to offer him, in exchange, the same quantity of
cloth of a worse quality, would not the merchant to whom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>proposal is made, immediately calculate the value of both commodities,
and demand the difference of the value between what
he was to give, and what he was to receive? Could ever this difference
be considered as any thing else than the difference between
the real worth of the commodities? But were they to exchange at
London an hundred pounds of fine silver bullion, for the same
weight at Paris; then if the merchant demanded one grain more
than he was to give, it must be upon the account of transportation;
because, weight for weight, there is not the smallest difference between
equal weights of the fine metals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bills of exchange, then, being all conceived in denominations of
money of accompt, realized in coin; and coin changing in its value
with regard to bullion; it is evident that the real par cannot
be computed upon the bullion alone contained in the coin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.16'></a>Obj. Exchange regulates the price of bullion.</div>

<p class='c001'>If it is objected, that since it is the course of exchange which regulates
the price of bullion, all variations between bullion and
coin ought to be ascribed to that cause.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.17'></a>Answ. Denied: exchange only raises its price; the mint price pulls it down.</div>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that it is not the course of exchange which regulates
the price of bullion; but exchange makes it ascend from the
price to which it is regulated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.18'></a>Balance upon the real par, no mark of a balance upon trade; proved by examples.</div>

<p class='c001'>The mint price regulates the price of bullion; and there it will
nearly stand, while the balance of trade is either at par, or favourable
to a country. Exchange therefore, or a wrong balance,
can only make it rise; and it returns to where it was, by the force
of another principle.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the next place, were I to allow that the balance of trade regulates
the price of bullion, it would not follow that what is called
the <em>real par</em> of exchange is a rule to judge of the <em>balance of trade</em> of
a nation. Is it not plain, that if France, for example, being at present
obliged to send great sums into Germany, upon account of
the war (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1760,) has reduced the price of her coin to a par
with bullion, that all nations will profit of it as much in their
trade with France, as if the balance was become favourable to
them; since the course of exchange will then answer according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>to the conversion of bullion for bullion in all remittances to
France.</p>

<p class='c001'>But were France at present to remit money to any other country,
which has the balance favourable, and where coinage is paid, suppose
to Spain, while the balance between France and Spain is
supposed to be exactly even; would not the real par between the
money of Spain and of France mark an exchange against France,
for the value of the coinage imposed by Spain? This is the reason
why, in time of war, exchange between France and England appears
more favourable to England than in time of peace. But
does this anywise prove that the balance of trade is then more
in favour of England? by no means: for let me suppose the
balance of their trade to remain the same after the peace as at
present; is it not evident, that in proportion as the coin of France
shall rise above the bullion, that the <em>balance of trade</em> will become, in
appearance, against England?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.19'></a>Balance of trade, what?</div>

<p class='c001'>By the <em>balance of trade</em>, I here constantly understand a certain
quantity of bullion sent by one nation to another, to pay what
they have not been able to compensate by an exchange of their
commodities, remittances, &amp;c. and not that which they compute
in their bills as the difference between the respective values of
coin and bullion in both countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>How, then, is the real par of exchange to be regulated, so as to
determine which nation pays a balance upon the exchange of their
commodities?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.20'></a>The real par of exchange to be fixed by the fluctuating value of the coin, not by the permanent quantity of the bullion it contains.</div>

<p class='c001'>I answer, To determine that question, let bullion over all the
commercial world be stated at 100, and let coin in every country
be compared with it, according to the current price. In England,
for example, (were all disorders of the coin removed) coin must
always be as 100. In France, when the balance is favourable, at
108.27. In Germany (were the Emperor’s late regulation with Bavaria
to be made general) at 101. And so forth, according to the
price of coinage imposed every where. These advanced values
above the 100, never can rise higher; and the more the balance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>of their respective trade is unfavourable, the nearer they will severally
come to 100; below which they never can fall. These fluctuations
will constantly be marked in exchange; because all circumstances
are exactly combined by merchants; but the <em>balance of
the trade</em> will only be marked <em>by what exchange is made to vary from
these proportions</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.21'></a>Proof of this proposition.</div>

<p class='c001'>Let me suppose the trade of France favourable upon the whole,
by great commissions from Cadiz, and bullion at the same time to
be carried to the mint at 8 <i>per cent.</i> below the price of coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me suppose, that upon all the trade of England with France,
there shall be, at that time, a balance of 2 <i>per cent.</i> sent from France
to England in bullion; and upon the trade with Germany a balance
of 1 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>I say, that the <em>par of exchange</em> between England and France is 8 <i>per
cent.</i> against England; and that the <em>par of exchange</em> between Germany
and France is 7 <i>per cent.</i> I state it at this rate; because the
balance being supposed favourable for the three nations, the value
of their coin with respect to their bullion ought to be in proportion
to the mint price.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>course of exchange</em>, therefore, if it be a rule to judge by,
ought to mark 6 <i>per cent.</i> against England; which I say is 2 <i>per cent.</i>
in her favour: and the exchange with Germany ought to mark
6 <i>per cent.</i> against Germany; which I call 1 <i>per cent.</i> in her favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>An example will make this plain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose English guineas, German carolins, and French Louis,
to be all of the same weight and fineness; I say, the <em>real par</em> in the
example we have stated is, between Paris and London, 100 Louis
are equal to 108 guineas; because the 100 Louis are worth 100
guineas in London, and 108 guineas are worth no more than 100
Louis in Paris. Again, between Paris and Francfort, 100 Louis
are equal to 107 carolins; because 108 carolins are worth at Paris
100 Louis; and 101 Louis at Francfort are worth 100 carolins;
consequently, the difference between 7 and 8 is the <em>real par</em>, to
wit, 100 Louis for 101 carolins. Next, as to the par between London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and Francfort, here 100 carolins equal 101 guineas; because
100 carolins in London are worth 100 guineas; and 101 guineas
at Francfort are worth no more than 100 carolins.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now in the ordinary way of reckoning the <em>real par</em>, the 100
Louis, 100 carolins, and 100 guineas, are all supposed to be of the
same value, in the three markets; and the difference between
this supposed value, and what is paid for it, is supposed to be a
loss upon trade. In this light, the nation’s loss resembles the loss
incurred by him, who, when he goes to the bank, and pays ten
pounds sterling in coin, for a bank-note, says, that he has given
ten pounds for a bit of paper, not worth one farthing; reckoning
the value of the note, at the real par of the paper it is writ upon.</p>

<p class='c001'>The general rule, therefore, as I apprehend, is, to settle the
real par of different coins, not according to the <em>bullion</em> they contain,
but according to the bullion they can buy with them in
their own market at the time.</p>

<p class='c001'>If 1000 pounds weight of guineas can purchase at London
1000 pounds weight of standard bullion; and that 1000 pounds
of the same weight of Louis can buy at Paris 1080 pounds weight
of the same standard bullion; then the 1000 pounds weight of
guineas is at the real par with 925<sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>1000</sub> pounds weight of the
Louis, and not worth 1000, as is commonly supposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the doctrine laid down in this chapter be found solid; if no
essential circumstance has been overlooked, which ought to have
entred into our combinations, (points left to the reader to determine)
then we may conclude,</p>

<p class='c001'><i>1mo</i>, That the course of exchange, in the way people take to calculate
the real par, is no rule for judging of the balance of trade.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>2do</i>, That the great duty laid upon the fabrication of the French
coin, either deceives the English nation, and makes them conclude,
from the course of exchange, that their commerce with
France is extremely disadvantageous: or, if it be really disadvantageous,
that it is the imposition of a duty on coinage in the
French mint which occasions it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>It is a question belonging to the theory of commerce, and not
to that which we are now upon, to examine the nature of a disadvantageous
trade, and to investigate the principles pointing out
the commodities which every country ought to encourage for exportation,
and those which are the most profitable to take in return.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn2.22'></a>Application of these principles to the English trade with France.</div>

<p class='c001'>Upon these principles the trade of England with France must be
examined, and upon examination it will be found whether that
trade be advantageous or hurtful. Here the question is reduced to
this; Whether from the course of exchange it may be concluded
that the balance of trade is against England, because the French
crown is commonly paid with thirty-two pence sterling? We have
decided that it cannot. If there be no other objections against the
trade of France but this loss upon exchange; and if it be true
that this is no proof of trade being against England, but only the
consequence of her free coinage; then it will follow, that England
may lay as many restrictions, duties, and clogs, upon the French
trade, as she pleases, and may even reduce it to nothing, without
ever removing the cause of complaint; while at the same time she
may be ruining a trade, which pays her upon the whole a great
balance, and upon which trade she has it in her power, by following
a different system in her mint, to render her exchange as favourable
as with any other nation in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>This point seems to be a matter of no small importance to England;
since (from a mistake in point of fact, into which she is
led from a delusive appearance) a very lucrative trade, when considered
by the balance it produces, may, upon false principles, be
proscribed as disadvantageous.</p>

<p class='c001'>These questions, however, are not as yet considered as entirely
discussed, and they shall be a little farther examined in the following
chapter.</p>

<hr class='c006' />

  <h4 id='ch3' class='c015'>CHAP. III. <br /> <i>Is the loss which the course of exchange marks upon the trade of Great Britain with France real or apparent?</i></h4>
</div>

<div  class='c007'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.1'></a>Reason for proposing this question.</div>

<p class='c001'>Questions are here proposed, which I do not pretend to resolve;
all I aim at is to discover how they may be resolved.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this inquiry shall prove an incitement to men of better capacity
to review the same subjects, who have more extensive combinations,
more experience, and better information as to facts, in
that respect it has some degree of merit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.2'></a>Suppositions.</div>

<p class='c001'>I answer to the question proposed, that if the imposition of a
duty on coinage in England would have the effect of rendring
her trade with France more lucrative, then the loss marked by the
course of exchange is real, at least in part; if otherwise, it is only
apparent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.3'></a>Principles.</div>

<p class='c001'>What makes the commerce with any country lucrative, is the
balance paid upon the exchange of their commodities.</p>

<p class='c001'>What regulates the quantity of commodities taken from any
country, in the way of trade, is the wants of the country demanding;
and what sets the balance even, is the reciprocal wants of
the other country. Nations do not give up correspondence with
their neighbours, because these do not accept of merchandize in
exchange for merchandize, but because they find their advantage
in supplying their wants upon easier terms elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every merchant seeks to sell dear; and the dearer he can sell,
the greater is his profit: that merchant, therefore, must thrive
most, who sells dearest, and who at the same time <em>can afford</em> to sell
cheapest.</p>

<p class='c001'>If an imposition on coinage shall enable England to sell dearer,
without depriving her of the advantage of being able to sell as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>cheap as at present, then it will follow, that an imposition on coinage
will be advantageous. If it shall lay her under a necessity of
selling dearer, and deprive her of the possibility of selling so cheap
as formerly, then the imposition of coinage will be hurtful.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.4'></a>How the paying for coinage affects the profits on goods exported.</div>

<p class='c001'>These principles premised, as a foundation for our reasoning,
let us first consider the influence of coinage upon the profits on
<em>exportation</em>; and then proceed to inquire into the influence it has
upon articles of <em>importation</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the first, I must observe, that England, as well as every
other country, has several articles of exportation which are peculiar
to herself, and others which she must sell in competition with
other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The price of what is peculiar is determined by the competition
of those who furnish at home, and the lowest price is regulated
by their minimum of profit. The price of what is common is regulated
by the competition of those who furnish from different
countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the prices of what is peculiar shall remain, as before, attached
to the denominations of the coin, after the imposition of a duty
on coinage, the competition of those who furnish will remain the
same as before; because prices will not vary; but the stranger,
who buys, must nevertheless pay an advanced price for such merchandize,
because the nation’s coin, with which they are purchased,
will be raised in its value with respect to bullion, the only
price he can pay with. This is the price of coinage: and this
imposition has the good effect of obliging strangers to pay dearer
than before, in favour of a benefit resulting therefrom to the
state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, if it be observed that the demand made by the English
for goods peculiar to France, (while these remain in France at
the same price as formerly) does not diminish in proportion as the
loss upon exchange happens to rise; why should we suppose that
the demand for goods peculiar to England should diminish, for a
similar reason?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>If the rise, however, in the price of exchange should diminish
the foreign demand for such English goods, by raising the price
of them in the foreign market, this, at least, will prove that
coinage does not make prices fall proportionally at home; because,
if they should fall, strangers would buy as cheap as formerly:
the prime cost (as it would appear upon the accounts of their
English correspondents) would diminish in proportion to the loss
upon exchange in remitting to England, and would just compensate
it: so upon the whole, the price of the merchandize would
be the same in the foreign market as before.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the imposition of coinage, therefore, be said to raise the
price of English merchandize in foreign markets, it must be allowed
that it will not raise the value of the pound sterling at home,
by sinking the value of commodities: that is to say, the prices of
commodities will adhere to the denominations of the coin; and
the coin bearing an advanced value, above what it bore formerly,
strangers must pay it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But will not this diminish the demand for English goods? Not
if they be peculiar to England, as we here suppose. But allowing
it should, will not this diminution of demand sink the value of
the English coin, by influencing the balance of trade? If so, it
will render remittances to England more advantageous: consequently,
it will recall the demand. The disease, therefore, in this
case, seems to draw the remedy along with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now what appears here to be a remedy against a disease, is at
present, as we may call it, the ordinary English diet, since it is
sinking the coin to the price of bullion. If, therefore, the having
coin always as cheap as bullion, can be any advantage to trade,
the nation is sure of having it, whenever the balance is unfavourable,
notwithstanding the imposition of a duty on coinage.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.5'></a>When the balance is favourable.</div>

<p class='c001'>Trade has its vicissitudes, and all nations find, at times, that
their neighbours must depend upon them. On such occasions, the
balance of their commerce is greatly in their favour.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Is it not, therefore, an advantage to have a principle at home,
which, upon such occasions, is capable of diminishing with us the
value of that merchandize (bullion) which strangers must give
as the price of all they buy?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.6'></a>And how, when unfavourable.</div>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, the same principle seems to fly to the assistance
of trade, when the balance becomes unfavourable, as it virtually
diminishes to strangers the price of all our commodities, by
raising in our market the value of that commodity, (bullion)
which they must give as the price of what they buy.</p>

<p class='c001'>This may suffice, in general, upon exportation. It is a hint
from a person not versed in commerce; and as such it is humbly
submitted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.7'></a>How the paying for coinage affects the profits on goods imported.</div>

<p class='c001'>I now pass to the second part of this operation, to wit, the influence
which the imposition of coinage has upon the interests of
trade, when the question is to purchase the commodities of other
countries. These operations are quite different, and in examining
this theory they must be carefully distinguished.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.8'></a>When the balance is favourable.</div>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how the imposition of coinage, during the favourable
balance of trade, procures to the nation an advanced price
upon the sale of her exports. As long as it remains favourable, it
must produce the same good effect with regard to her importations,
by sinking at home the price of the bullion with which she
must pay for them. Bullion must become cheap in the English
market, in proportion as the balance of her trade is favourable, and
in proportion as it is cheaper there than in other nations (with
respect to their respective coins) in the same proportion, the nation
has an advantage in paying what she buys, or in employing her
bullion for extending the fund of her own commerce.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.9'></a>And how, when unfavourable.</div>

<p class='c001'>Upon the other hand, should the balance of her trade turn
against her, her bullion rises. This renders the price of all foreign
merchandize dearer to the importers than otherwise they
would be; because they must pay them in bullion. But this loss
is at present constantly incurred; and when incurred, is not <em>national</em>,
the national loss is upon the balance of the trade; but whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>this balance be paid in bullion at the mint price, or in bullion at
the price of coin, the balance of the trade is just the same. Now,
if this wrong balance (which I here suppose to proceed only from
the imports exceeding the exports upon trade in general) renders
the purchase of foreign commodities dearer to the merchants,
without costing more to the nation; is not this so far advantageous,
that it discourages importations, just at the time they
ought to be discouraged, and thereby may <em>tend</em> to set the balance
even again?</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus I have endeavoured to analize the influence of this principle
in the four cases; to wit, upon exportation and importation,
under a favourable and unfavourable balance of trade. These different
combinations must always be examined separately, or else
obscurity and confusion will ensue.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must also observe, that there are still other combinations to
be attended to, although it be superfluous to apply the principles
to them; because the variations proceeding from them are self-evident.
I mean, that this question may be considered as relative
to a nation which has coinage free, with respect to another nation
where that duty is imposed. In this case we may decide, that as
far as the situation of the latter is advantageous, so far must that
of the former be disadvantageous, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question may also be considered in relation to countries who
have either the duty on coinage the same, or different. When they
have the same, there can be no advantage on either side; excepting
in this respect, that the nation which has, upon an average, the
balance of trade in her favour, will thereby render her trade still
more favourable than it would be, were the coinage free on both
sides.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn3.10'></a>The more trade is favourable, the more adviseable it is to impose a duty upon coinage.</div>

<p class='c001'>From which we may conclude, that the more a nation has the
advantage in point of trade, the more it is her interest to impose
the duty of coinage. When the imposition is unequal in the two
countries, I apprehend that the country which lays the smallest
duty upon her coinage, may be considered as having it altogether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>free, and that the other may be considered as imposing no more
than the difference.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon these principles must the question here proposed be resolved.
They never can decide as to the matter of fact, to wit,
whether the French trade is hurtful or lucrative: all we are warranted
to conclude from them is, that the trade of Great Britain
would be more advantageous with France than it is, were a duty
on coinage to be laid in England as high as there. In that sense,
we may say, that the apparent loss by exchange is a proof that
coin is commonly dearer in France than in England; from which
a loss may be implied; but the loss upon exchange no way denotes
the degree of loss upon the trade, and much less does it certify
that the balance upon the whole is against Great Britain.</p>
<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4' class='c015'>CHAP. IV. <br /><i>Of the different methods of imposing coinage; and of the influence they respectively have upon the value of the money-unit, and upon the domestic interests of the nation.</i></h4>

<div  class='c007'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.1'></a>Two ways of imposing coinage.</div>

<p class='c001'>There are two ways of imposing coinage; one by positive
law, and by the force of that authority which is every
where lodged in the legislature; the other, which is more gentle,
renders the imposition almost insensible, and is effectuated by the
influence of the principles of commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the one and the other the same end may be obtained; with
this difference, that all circumstances must yield to the force of
authority: and when this is employed, coinage is imposed as a
tax upon coin, in spight of all resistance; whereas, in the other
case, the effect takes place by degrees: it is no tax upon coin;
but it is liable to interruptions; and therefore, upon a general recoinage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of all the specie of a nation, it is not so effectual as the
first; although it may answer perfectly well for supporting a fund
of good specie, and for replacing all the diminutions it may suffer
from melting down or exportation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.2'></a>Plan laid down in this chapter.</div>

<p class='c001'>I shall now give examples of the one and the other method: I
shall point out some of the consequences which attend both: I shall
chalk out a rough draught of the principles, which may be applied
in forming a plan for laying on that imposition in the English
mint: and last of all, I shall shew how the experiment may be
made.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.3'></a>How coinage is imposed by authority.</div>

<p class='c001'>Were the government of England to call in, at present, all the
coin in the nation, in order to be recoined, and to fix the mint price
of it, as gold and silver standard bullion, at —— <i>per cent.</i> below the
value of the new coin; this would be imposing coinage by positive
law; and being an arbitrary operation upon the coin of the
nation, could not fail of influencing the value of the money-unit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.4'></a>How by consent.</div>

<p class='c001'>Were the government, on the other hand, to give orders to the
mint, to pay gold and silver bullion for the future, no dearer than
—— <i>per cent.</i> below the coin, this would be no arbitrary operation
on the coin of the nation, and would not (as I imagine) influence
the value of the money-unit, although it might sink the price of
bullion, by the influence of the principles of commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>The different consequences of these two methods of imposing
coinage are now to be explained.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.5'></a>When by authority, what is the consequence?</div>

<p class='c001'>Were England, during a war, or at any time when the balance of
her trade is unfavourable, to impose coinage by law, in the manner
proposed, the consequence would be, that all the specie in Great
Britain, or at least a considerable part of it, might possibly be
melted down, and sold in the market for bills of exchange. <a id='sn4.6'></a><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The metals are exported.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In
a nation of trade, where credit is so extensively and solidly established,
there would, in such a case, be no difficulty to find an
outlet abroad for all the metals in the kingdom; because then
every thing would be considered as profit, which was less than
the —— <i>per cent.</i> loss in carrying the coin to the mint.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>If it is objected, that this plan has been many times executed
in France, particularly in 1709, and 1726, without any such inconveniences;
I answer, as I have done upon other occasions, circumstances
are to be examined.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.7'></a>How, in France, this is prevented in some measure.</div>

<p class='c001'>Upon such occasions, in France, the coin is ordered to the mint,
upon penalties against those who shall not obey; melting down is
strictly inquired into, and severely punished; all the roads which
lead to foreign countries are beset with guards, and no coin is suffered
to be exported; all debts may be demanded in coin; and all
internal commerce is carried on with specie.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a violent method of imposing a tax upon all the coin in
the nation; and the general coinage is made with no other intention.
In the coinage 1709, this tax amounted to 23<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>13</sub> <i>per cent.</i>
(Dutot, Vol. I. p. 104.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.8'></a>French politics, as to coin, not generally understood.</div>

<p class='c001'>Under these circumstances, it is very evident, that those who
have coin or bullion must either carry it to the mint, or bury it:
there is no middle course to be followed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me here observe by the bye, how frequent it is to see people
blame the greatest ministers rashly, and impute to them the most
absurd opinions concerning the most simple matters. How much
have the ministers of France been laugh’d at, for pretending to forbid
the exportation of coin, to pay the balance of their trade?
They did not forbid the exportation of the coin for paying of their
debts: On the contrary, the King has sometimes had his bankers,
whose business it was to send coin to Holland for that purpose,
as we shall explain in another place. This, I think, is common
sense.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the ridicule is turned against those states, who forbid the
melting down and exportation of coin, where coinage is free, I
must also make answer, that <em>there</em> the prohibition is laid on, to save
to government the expence of perpetually recoining what is melted
down, or of coining the foreign specie, imported in return for
that of the nation which has been exported without necessity.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Let us next examine the consequence of imposing coinage by
law, when the plan is so laid down (no matter how) as not to be
frustrated by the total desertion of the mint.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.9'></a>How coinage influences the price of inland commodities.</div>

<p class='c001'>Is it not evident, from the principles laid down in the first chapter,
that, in this case, the value of the coin must rise, not only
with respect to bullion, but with respect to every commodity: or
in other words, that the prices of commodities must fall universally
with respect to the denominations of the coin. For who
will pay the same price for a commodity, after he has been obliged
to pay —— <i>per cent.</i> to purchase the price with which he must
buy? But the moment the great operation of the general coinage
is over, and that trade begins to work its former effects, while
the balance of it is supposed to remain unfavourable, all prices
will return to their former rate, with regard to the denominations
of the coin, by the operation of another principle. The new coin
procured at so much cost will then fall to the price of bullion;
that is to say, all the price paid for coinage will be lost, and
consequently money will return to its former value; or in other
words, prices will be made to rise to their former height; because
then no body will be obliged to pay — <i>per cent.</i> to procure the price.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.10'></a>A case not to be resolved by this theory, but left to be verified by experiment.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now, it is the effect operated upon prices by the <em>return</em> of a favourable
balance, when coin <em>regains</em> an advanced price above bullion
by the influence of commerce, which my theory does not
reach to. I cannot discover a principle, which can force the prices
<em>of articles of inland consumption</em> to fall and fluctuate with the prices
of bullion; because I find them too closely attached to the denominations
of the coin; and that foreign commerce has not sufficient
influence upon them. As that combination is beyond my
reach to extricate, I leave it to the decision of experiment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.11'></a>An objection answered.</div>

<p class='c001'>Here a plain objection occurs against what has been said in the
twelfth chapter of the first part, viz. That the wearing of the English
coin has the effect of raising the price of corn in the market,
which would be made to fall upon a restitution of the coin to legal
weight. But the answer is plain. In the former case, the diminution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of the value of the coin was supposed real and permanent;
in which case, with time, it works its effects of raising prices
without doubt: but here the augmentation is not real, and the
fluctuations of the value of the coin with respect to bullion, are
both imperceptible to any but merchants, and at the same time
so uncertain, that they have not time to work their effects upon
the price of other commodities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were a balance of trade to continue long favourable, and were
coin to preserve, during all that time, the same advanced value
with regard to <em>bullion</em>, in that case I have little doubt but the value
of that universal commodity (bullion) in conjunction with the
operations and influence of foreign commerce, might reach inland
markets, and reduce the price of commodities. But this is seldom
the case (as I am apt to believe,) and in proportion as it is so,
more or less, will a duty on coinage influence the price of commodities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.12'></a>Coinage affects the price of bullion immediately; and that of commodities indirectly.</div>

<p class='c001'>Coinage therefore ought, upon many occasions, to be considered
as affecting <em>immediately</em> the price of bullion only, and that of commodities
<em>indirectly</em>: whereas the diminution of the intrinsic value
of the coin, by immediately affecting <em>price</em>, must consequently affect
the rate of every thing which is given for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine the consequence of imposing coinage by
the influence of the principles of commerce.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.13'></a>Consequence of the price of coinage imposed with consent.</div>

<p class='c001'>The method here is to leave every one free to do with their coin,
or with their bullion, what they please. Do they incline to melt
down or export the coin, they may have entire liberty to do it: no
penalty ought to be imposed, other than that which will necessarily
follow, viz. the expence of procuring new coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to make our reasoning here more distinct, let us form
a supposition with regard to a new regulation of the British
coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The present confusion has convinced every man, that a reformation
of the coin is necessary; and the opinions of those who have
writ best upon that subject seem to be divided upon one main article.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The metals are disproportioned in the coin, the gold being
there to the silver, as 1 to 15.21, instead of being as 1 to 14.5. By
law, 113 grains of gold are made equal to 1718.7 grains of silver.
One party would have the silver adjusted to the gold; the other
would have the gold adjusted to the silver. This is the question, in
a few words. Now, suppose a middle course were taken, and that
the standard were to be fixed at the mean proportion of these two
values; that is, at the value of the half of 1718.7 grains fine
silver, added to the half of 113 grains fine gold; which, in the
first part of this book, we have shewn, by many arguments, to be
the only method of preserving an equality in the money-unit;
this will make the new pound consist of 1678.6 grains of fine silver,
and 115.77 grains fine gold: and this is also a sort of medium
between the two opinions.</p>

<p class='c001'>At that rate, the pound troy standard silver must be coined into
63 shillings and 6 pence, and the pound troy standard gold into
46 guineas, or pound-pieces, each worth 20 shillings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, if upon both species 8 <i>per cent.</i> coinage were imposed,
(for as all this is a pure supposition, it is no matter at what rate
the coinage be stated) then the mint price of the pound troy fine
silver must be fixed at 63<i>s.</i> 1¾<i>d.</i> and the mint price of a pound
troy of fine gold at 45<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> ¾<i>d.</i> sterling.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.14'></a>That bullion is brought to the mint when trade is favourable.</div>

<p class='c001'>Suppose then (as an example) that the mint price of fine
bullion should be fixed at 8 <i>per cent.</i> below the coin in England;
What principle could oblige people to carry bullion to be coined?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, When the balance of trade is favourable for England,
that balance must sooner or later be paid in bullion. If trade still
continues favourable, after the first balance is paid, what use can
those who have the bullion make of it, if there be no demand for
it to work it into plate? To export it, by employing it in trade,
does not remove the difficulty; because, while the balance stands
favourable, export as much as you will, more bullion must enter
than it is possible to export, in the way of trade; for we do not
suppose that in exporting it, it is to be given away gratis. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>bullion, therefore, not being demanded for exportation; not being
permitted to pass current for money; and not being demanded for
making into plate; must be employed so as to be profitable to the
owner one way or other. For this purpose it must be lent, or employed
within the country for purchasing some sort of effects which
produce an income. For this purpose the bullion must be coined,
in order to render it capable of circulation, and of becoming price.</p>

<p class='c001'>At all times, therefore, when in a country there is bullion, not
demanded as such, the proprietor carries it to the mint, he sells it
at the mint price; and as this mint price is stated at 8 <i>per cent.</i> below
the price of coin, he gives it for the price he can get for it:
this he does without regret, because, if next day he should want
to change his coin into bullion again, he will find it in the market
at the same value.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be farther objected, that rather than carry it to the mint at
8 <i>per cent.</i> discount, people will lend it to foreigners: I answer, that
if it be lent to foreigners, this lending will turn what we call the
balance of trade against England, and then certainly no body will
carry bullion to be coined; for in which ever way it happens that
more bullion is exported than is imported, in every case the price
of exchange and of bullion must rise; and this is constantly constructed,
though very improperly, as a balance of trade against
England; which, to mention it by the bye, is another reason to
prove how ill people judge of the prosperity of trade by the course
of exchange, since the lending of money, as well as the paying
of debts, equally turns exchange against the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bullion, therefore, never will be carried to the mint, when it
can be disposed of above the mint price; and both theory and experience,
over all Europe, where, England excepted, coinage is
imposed, proves, that bullion is carried to the mint, and sold below
the price of coin, weight for weight of equal fineness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.15'></a> How the mint price of the metals may be allowed to vary.</div>

<p class='c001'>By fixing the mint price at 8 <i>per cent.</i> below the value of the coin,
it is not necessary that this price be made invariable: a power may
be lodged somewhere, by the state, to make deviations from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>standard price. A war breaks out; large quantities of coin are
exported; specie becomes scarce: May not the state, at such a time,
deliver coin at the mint at the current price of the bullion? Let
matters come to the worst, the price can never possibly rise above
the present value, to wit, that of the coin, when it is preserved at
its true weight. If peace returns, and trade becomes favourable,
the mint may then be ordered to sink its price, in proportion to
circumstances. In short, the mint may receive bullion at different
prices, at different times, without occasioning the smallest confusion
by such variations in the intrinsic value of the current specie,
which must constantly be the same. It is of no consequence to
any person who receives it, whether the coinage costs nothing, or
whether it costs 8 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn4.16'></a>Influence of this method of imposing coinage on the price of commodities, and value of the pound sterling.</div>

<p class='c001'>By this method of imposing coinage, all the advantages reaped
by France may be reaped by England. The bullion will be allowed
to fall as low as with them, when trade is favourable. If it rises,
upon a wrong balance, the mint need not be stopped, in case coin
be found wanting for the uses of the state; and when that necessary
demand is satisfied, the mint price may be reduced again.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not see how the value of the pound sterling can be anywise
influenced by this plan of imposing coinage: because the
imposition is not arbitrary; nor can it either add to or take from
the mass of the metals appointed by statute to enter into the coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only possible influence coinage can have upon the value of
the pound sterling, is by lowering the price of commodities. If it
has this effect, I still agree that it is the same thing as if an addition
were made to the metals in the coin. Experience alone will
resolve the question: and if by this it is found that prices are
not affected by it, then we may safely declare, that no variation
has been occasioned in the value of the money-unit, and consequently
no injury done to any interest within the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>This proposition, however, requires some limitations. The
prices of commodities, certainly, will not be affected <em>immediately</em> by
the imposition of coinage, in the way it has been proposed to lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>it on; but I do not say that, upon some occasions, they may not
be affected by slow degrees.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the balance of trade at any time has stood long favourable
for England; when the coin has remained long considerably
above the price of bullion; and when, consequently, the mint has
been well employed; then the value of commodities, as has been
said, may become influenced by the operations of foreign commerce,
and be sunk in their price. Yet even here this consequence
is by no means certain; for this reason, that what turns the balance
of trade in favour of a nation is the demand which foreign markets
make for her commodities: now this demand, as it raises the
value of her coin above her bullion, so it raises the price of her
commodities, by increasing foreign competition to acquire them.</p>

<p class='c001'>These combinations are very intricate, and more properly belong
to the doctrine of commerce than to that which we are now upon.
I have thrown them in here, for the sake of extending the present
theory a little farther, and for enabling us to account for appearances
which may happen upon the imposition of coinage, supposing
it should be thought proper to make the experiment.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch5' class='c015'>CHAP. V. <br /><i>How an Experiment may be made to discover with Certainty the real Effects of the Imposition of Coinage.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We have dwelt very long upon this part of our subject, and
after all our endeavours to elucidate the principles which
ought to decide whether or not the imposition of coinage will raise
the value of the pound sterling, in a kingdom which, like Great
Britain, is in a mercantile correspondence with nations where
that duty is introduced, we have still been obliged to leave the final
decision of the question to an experiment.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>By that alone it will be clearly discovered, whether coinage will
have the effect, <i>1mo</i>, of sinking the prices of commodities, to the
prejudice of manufacturers; <i>2do</i>, of raising the price of the pound
sterling, to the prejudice of all the classes of debtors within the
nation; and <i>3tio</i>, of hurting trade, by putting England under the
necessity of selling dearer, without being able to sell as cheap as
before: or whether commodities will remain at their former prices;
the pound sterling at the same value; and England be enabled to
sell dearer to foreigners, when her commerce is favourable, without
being obliged upon other occasions to sell one bit dearer than
at present.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now give a hint concerning a proper method of making
the experiment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn5.1'></a>The plan of an experiment proposed.</div>

<p class='c001'>Suppose peace<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> restored, and a balance of trade favourable to England;
that government shall take the resolution to set about the
reformation of the coin; that they shall publish the plan of reformation
three years before it is intended to commence, according
to what was proposed in the 14th chapter of the first part; that
they shall make a change in the mean time upon the regulation
of the mint, by ordering all silver coin, and all guineas, except those
of George II. to pass by weight; that shillings shall be ordered to be
coined at 65 in the pound troy; the mint price, when at par with
the coin, remaining as at present with regard to the gold, and
raised to 65 new pence <i>per</i> ounce with regard to the silver. This,
I imagine, will furnish specie sufficient to the nation, and will make
no change upon the value of the pound sterling at present.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Written in the year 1761.</p>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn5.2'></a>The consequence of this will be to recall the old guineas from abroad.</div>

<p class='c001'>So soon as there shall be a few millions of silver coined free, let
the mint price both of gold and silver be diminished, suppose 4 <i>per
cent.</i> This, I imagine, will in a short time give an advanced price
to coin, and sink the price of bullion; which will have the effect
of recalling all the guineas of the late King from Holland and
Flanders; because coin being then dearer than bullion in England,
people will choose to send over current guineas to pay their English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>debts, rather than to remit bills of exchange. This circumstance
will naturally stop the coining of gold for some time; but if the
balance of trade shall continue favourable, the mint must, in time,
be set a-going.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn5.3'></a>During this experiment, a close attention must be had to the rate of prices.</div>

<p class='c001'>During this period, a strict attention must be had to the state of
prices. It is plain, that stopping the coining of gold ought not to
make them sink; since the daily augmentation upon the quantity
of the gold coin from abroad (which will not cost any coinage) will,
I imagine, be sufficient to compensate it. If, therefore, prices shall
be found to sink notwithstanding, this effect must proceed from a
combination among the merchants. An intelligent statesman will
quickly discover the true state of the case.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn5.4'></a>And if they vary, how to discover the true cause of it.</div>

<p class='c001'>If the sinking of the price is a necessary consequence of the imposition
of coinage, it will perhaps manifest itself by the following
symptoms: <i>1mo</i>, The profit of the English merchants upon goods
exported will be the same as before. <i>2do</i>, The price of the goods
exported will be the same as before in foreign markets. And <i>3tio</i>,
Exchange will mark as many <i>per cent.</i> favourable for England as
goods will have fallen in their price at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the fall of the prices be forced, by a combination among the
merchants, their profits will be greater; and very probably no
variation will appear upon the exchange in favour of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let, therefore, the course of exchange be attended to, and by
this the minister will be able to judge, when silver and gold are
to be brought to the mint. The moment exchange, and the price
of bullion in the London market, shall shew that coin is near the
full price of coinage above the price of bullion, then the time approaches
when the mint is to be set a-going.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn5.5'></a>Farther consequences of this experiment.</div>

<p class='c001'>It is to no purpose to pretend to prognosticate the effect of this
change in the policy of the English mint. Effects it will certainly
produce, which every one will interpret according as their interest
may dictate to them. But the principles of trade are now too
well known. English ministers are too well instructed in the theory
of it, and too sharp-sighted to be deceived by appearances. A trial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of a few years will render the consequences of this innovation
perfectly clear; and before the great reform takes place, the principles
will be so well confirmed, as not to leave a shadow of
doubt concerning the course which is best to be followed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The silver coined in the interval, at 65 shillings in the pound troy,
may then be rated at its just value, in proportion to the new pound
sterling, and may form a denomination by itself, easily to be distinguished
by the stamp. If it should happen to fall into inconvenient
fractions, let it be called in, and received at the mint above the
rate of other bullion: the loss will not be considerable; and it
cannot be expected that any plan can be proposed which is liable
to none.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another method is, to coin, during the interval of the three
years, shillings of the weight adapted to the new regulation, and
to give them a value proportioned to the present currency, in the
mean time.</p>

<p class='c001'>In whatever way the experiment be made, by the imposition of
the price of coinage, a great expence will be saved to the state, the
expence of the mint. The national coin will be kept at home,
and when exported, will be preserved from the melting pot. This
is the case with the French coin. Why are louis d’ors worth as much
as guineas in many foreign countries? It is evident that they are
not intrinsically worth so much by 4½ <i>per cent.</i> but they are virtually
so in the eyes of money-jobbers; because, being exported
from France while coin is fallen low by a wrong balance of
their trade, they still retain an advanced value, for this reason, that
when sent back, upon a revolution in trade, they are better than
bullion, by all the advanced price of the French coin, at a time
when their balance becomes favourable; and for this reason they
are sought for, and are paid for in proportion: whereas any bullion,
or any coin whatsoever, is as good to send to England as her
own proper specie; which occasions the guineas to be melted down
without the smallest regret.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn5.6'></a>Can we estimate the wealth of a nation by the quantity of its coin?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>It would be a curious inquiry to examine the proportion of money
coined in England and in France, and to compare the quantities
coined with the quantities in existence. People commonly estimate
the wealth of a nation by the quantity of its coined money.
Some go farther, and imagine that the quantity of the coined money
is the representation and even the measure of its wealth.
I cannot be of this opinion, for reasons which I have given in another
place; but I shall only observe here, that coin, like every other
thing, is made in proportion to the occasions people have for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The more equality there is between industry and consumption in
any nation, the less coin they have occasion for, in proportion to
the alienations they make; the more a nation is given to penury
and hoarding, their occasions for coin are proportionally greater.</p>

<p class='c001'>An example will make this plain. Suppose two markets in a
country, where paper does not circulate; that 1000 people come
to the one to sell, in order to buy; that 500 resort to the other, with
an intention only to sell, and 500 others only to buy. In the last
example, it is evident, that there must be brought to market, in
specie, the price of all the goods offered to sale, or else a part must
remain unsold: but in the first case, a much smaller proportion
will suffice; because no sooner has any one sold the goods he has,
than he buys from another what he has occasion for; and so the
same money circulates from hand to hand, so much, that if we
suppose every one of the thousand persons to sell for the precise
value of what he buys, every man will carry home the same sum
of money he had in his pocket on coming to market. Those who
begin by selling, will carry home their own coin; those who begin
with buying, will replace what they had with the coin of other
people.</p>

<p class='c001'>In proportion, therefore, to the trucks of commodities for commodities,
money is the less necessary; and in proportion as people
sell, in order to realize, coin is the more necessary. When hoarding
was in fashion, and when lending upon interest was little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>known, had alienation been as frequent as at present, the total of
coin must have been much greater. At present no body hoards,
where lending at interest is lawful, except in nations where credit
is precarious. This was the case in England about 1695, and is
perhaps the case at present in France<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Hoarding from this motive
is more hurtful than from any other: because, at the same
time that it deprives the public of a circulating value, by preventing
the lending of the coin of the nation, it also prevents bullion
from being lent by neighbouring states, and from being carried to
the mint by those who have it at home. Whereas hoarding from
avarice has none of these inconveniences; and when credit is
good, there will always be found coin sufficient; because a demand
for it will always procure it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn5.7'></a>Just as we can estimate a man’s estate by the weight of his purse.</div>

<p class='c001'>Why is there so little coin in England, in proportion to what
there is in France? Does any man imagine that this is a mark of
poverty? By no means. Let the state proscribe the currency of
paper money, the coin will quickly return; because then it will
be demanded. But at present the paper supplies its place, and so
it goes abroad in order to gain more; whereas in France it remains
at home, and produces nothing. The wealth of a nation can no
more be estimated by the quantity of its coin, than the wealth of
private people by the weight of their purse. Were a person, from
that circumstance, to calculate the wealth of the British courtiers,
assembled at the Groom Porter’s, he would find himself grossly
deceived in his conclusions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>In deducing the principles of every branch of politics, it is of
great importance, at setting out, to treat every one separately;
to avoid intricate combinations of circumstances; and to learn
how to distinguish between the operations of the general principle
in question, and the influence of an accidental circumstance, which
may throw the decision of a particular case upon a principle different
from that upon which our attention is fixed at the time. Let
the combination and complication of circumstances be ever so great,
all and every one of them constantly remain under the influence
of one principle or other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great art, therefore, is to have the whole plan of the science
so ready at command, as to be able to combine and apply every
principle of it to the case proposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we discover of what importance it is to be exactly informed
as to facts, and how utterly insufficient the best theory is
in the hands of any person, who is not at the same time a thorough
practitioner in the political science.</p>

<p class='c001'>In treating of the application of principles to particular cases,
we must constantly go upon this hypothesis, that in the case
proposed there are no unknown circumstances, which may be repugnant
to the exact combination of those which have entred into
our supposition.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.1'></a>The use of a miscellaneous chapter at the end of a subject.</div>

<p class='c001'>The use, therefore, of a miscellaneous chapter, after the deduction
of the general principles is over, is to serve as an exercise
upon them. This is done by introducing questions which may
tend to illustrate or explain the matters already treated of, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>which have not been introduced in the body of the work, for fear
of rendering combinations too complicated, and of drawing the
attention from the main object of inquiry. When a particular appearance,
also, seems to contradict a known principle, that appearance
may here be analized, and the particularity of the case pointed
out, and ranged under the principle which influences it. Numbers
of objections also occur to readers of such inquiries, and which
even naturally occur to the author himself, although he be obliged
to take no notice of them at the time, for fear of interrupting his
subject; these may properly find a place in a subsidiary chapter.
It is, however, to no purpose to attempt to exhaust any political
subject. The combinations of circumstances are infinite; and
therefore people must content themselves with deducing all the
principles by which they may be resolved, leaving the rest to the
reader’s ingenuity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.2'></a> Quest. 1. Why does the doctrine of money appear so intricate?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. I.</span> The first question I shall propose for illustrating this
subject shall be, Whence it comes to pass that the doctrine of money
is so extremely difficult and involved?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.3'></a> Answ. Because it is perplexed with jargon.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> This I ascribe chiefly to the introduction of a money-jargon,
employed by people who have had the management of
mints, or who have been practical merchants, without knowing
any thing of the theory of their business.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.4'></a> The denominations of coin are confounded with the intrinsic value of it.</div>

<p class='c001'>As long as money went by weight, and was considered as gold
and silver bullion, the whole doctrine of it remained clear and
intelligible: but the introduction of a numerary value, or denominations
of money of accompt, sometimes attached to one quantity
of the metals, sometimes to another; and the interest of Princes,
which made them endeavour to persuade their subjects that the
stamp of the coin was sufficient to give a value to it; has both introduced
an unintelligible language, and has really involved the
subject with so many extraneous circumstances, that when we consider
every thing, the perplexity is not much to be wondered at.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now endeavour to reduce all these perplexities under some
general heads.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.5'></a> The terms metal, money, coin, bullion, and price, are all considered as synonimous.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><i>1mo</i>, The first is, confounding ideas quite different in themselves.
The terms <em>gold</em> and <em>silver</em>, <em>money of accompt</em>, <em>coin</em>, <em>bullion</em>, and
<em>price</em>, are often understood and made use of as synonimous, although
no things can be more different.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.6'></a> What is meant by <em>metal</em>?</div>

<p class='c001'>The terms <em>gold</em> and <em>silver</em> should convey to us no other idea than
that of pure physical substances.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What by <em>money</em>?</div>

<p class='c001'>That of <em>money of accompt</em> represents an invariable scale for measuring
value.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What by <em>coin</em>?</div>

<p class='c001'><em>Coin</em> conveys the idea of the public authority ascertaining the
exact proportion of fine and alloy in a mixed metal, and the realizing,
in a determinate weight of it, the invariable scale of money,
sometimes correctly, sometimes incorrectly.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What by <em>bullion</em>?</div>

<p class='c001'><em>Bullion</em> carries the idea of certain determinate mixtures of the
metals, commonly ascertained by some public stamp or other,
and drawing their value exactly from the proportion of the fine
metals they contain, the workmanship being considered as of no
value.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What by <em>price</em>?</div>

<p class='c001'><em>Price</em>, again, when considered as consisting in coin, is a more
complex idea still. In it are comprehended the value of the metals;
the authority of the stamp for the currency; the actual value of
the coin as a manufacture, above the value of it as a metal; the
common and universal equivalent of all things alienable; and the
mean value of the currency of which <em>price</em> is supposed to contain
exact aliquot parts, when perhaps it does not.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ideas, therefore, of <em>gold</em> and <em>silver</em>, of <em>money</em>, of <em>coin</em>, of <em>bullion</em>,
and of <em>price</em>, are all different; they are commonly confounded,
both in speaking and in writing: from this arises the first cause
of perplexity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.7'></a> The abuse of the terms <em>rising</em> and <em>sinking</em>, and inaccuracy of speech.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>2do</i>, The second is owing to the common method of estimating
the value, and the proportions between <em>gold</em> and <em>silver</em>; <em>coin</em> and
<em>bullion</em>; <em>money</em> and <em>merchandize</em>. The terms usually employed to express
such combinations are, <em>rising</em> and <em>sinking</em>, or the like: people
employ these terms, without previously agreeing upon the thing
which they are to consider as fixed. The value of one of the precious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>metals is constantly relative to that of the other; and yet,
without attending to this, we sometimes consider the gold,
and sometimes the silver, as the common measure; and while
one is talking of gold as a common measure, the person he
talks to is considering it perhaps as the thing measured. This inaccuracy,
in supposing sometimes the one as fixed, and sometimes
the other, involves us in great obscurities; especially when
we speak upon such matters with those who have not distinct combinations
of ideas: and if three or four people are engaged in a
conversation upon money, every one using the same term in a different
acceptation, the confusion which it causes is inextricable.</p>

<p class='c001'>In like manner, when we speak of coin and bullion, that of the
two ought to be considered as fixed which changes its proportion
of value the least with respect to all commodities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.8'></a> Prices attached to denominations of coin.</div>

<p class='c001'>Were prices attached to grains of silver and gold, bullion ought
in that case to be considered as fixed; but as they are more attached
to the denominations of the coin, coin ought to be considered
as fixed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.9'></a><em>Coinage raises the value of coin</em>, is a more proper expression than <em>Coinage sinks the price of commodities</em>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the next place, in speaking of coin and commodities, we say,
for example, that the imposition of coinage makes the prices of
commodities sink. We do not, in this case, speak correctly; because
if any thing ought to be considered as fixed, it is the relative
proportion of value between the different sorts of commodities.
In this case, therefore, I think it would be more proper to say, that
coinage raises the value of coin, than that it sinks the value of
commodities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.10'></a> How to avoid such ambiguities in speech.</div>

<p class='c001'>To prevent the ambiguity of such expressions from occasioning
confusion, and not to depart too far from common language, I
have frequently spoken of commodities as rising and sinking in
their values with respect to coin; but I have at the same time observed
the influence which that rising and sinking has upon the
rising and sinking of the value of the pound sterling realized in it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.11'></a> A case which cannot be resolved by this theory.</div>

<p class='c001'>I have not, however, concluded with equal certainty that the
rising and sinking in the value of bullion, <em>with respect to coin</em>, ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>to imply any change upon the value of the money-unit; because
I have not been able to determine whether prices ought to be considered
as most attached to the denominations of the coin, or to
the grains of the metals: except indeed in one case, to wit, when
the quantity of the metals comes to be augmented or diminished
in the coin. In that case, I have not hesitated to decide that, sooner
or later, the influence of trade must operate a rise or a fall in
the current value of the specie, which will be marked by an apparent
rise or fall in the price of all commodities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.12'></a> In speaking, we do not distinguish between pure metal and that which is mixed with alloy.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>3tio</i>, Our comparing the value of silver sometimes with the pure
metal, sometimes with that compounded with alloy, involves us
frequently in a language which is hardly to be understood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Says one, a pound of silver, troy, is worth 67 shillings. He means
a pound of fine silver. We in England, says another, coin our
pound troy of silver into 62 shillings. He means the pound of
standard silver, which contains 18 penny weights of copper. Says
a third, our pound of silver, which we coin into 62 shillings, is
not worth 57<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> He understands the shillings of fine silver of
the same weight with those of standard silver. Another affirms,
that an ounce of standard silver, which, at the mint, and in the
coin, is worth no more than 5<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> is worth in the market 5<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> He means, that one must pay at that rate for silver bullion,
when they purchase it with over-rated gold. At last comes Mr.
Cantillon, who, as a proof of the decline of the English commerce,
affirms to us, in his Analysis of trade, p. 133. that both
silver and gold bullion are dearer in the London market than in
the coin: at the same time, he might have discovered the cause of
it, from the lightness of the gold and silver currency at the time
he wrote; since the phænomenon could proceed from nothing
else: the new guineas must then have been sent abroad. Says a
Frenchman, one of our crowns of 3 livres, which passes for 60 sols,
is intrinsically worth no more than 56½ sols. He means, that the
fine silver it contains is worth no more than 56½ sols, according to
the mint price of the fine metals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.13'></a> Of the abuse of terms relative to the denomination of coins.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span><i>4to</i>, Another cause of perplexity in the money-jargon, is the prodigious
abuse of the terms which express the denominations of
the coin, or the numerary unit.</p>

<p class='c001'>French historians write familiarly of sums of money in livres
and crowns, through all the stages of the monarchy. English
writers (for the most part) do the same, in speaking of pounds
sterling. Nothing however is more different than the ideas expressed
by the same term.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.14'></a> This illustrated by an example.</div>

<p class='c001'>Were any person, talking of lengths and distances, to use the
word <em>foot</em>, sometimes to signify <em>yard</em>, sometimes <em>perch</em>; or to use
the word <em>mile</em>, to signify sometimes <em>league</em>, sometimes <em>inch</em>, and
sometimes <em>fathom</em>; who could comprehend one word of his discourse
concerning the matter? Would we not even laugh at such
a person, for pretending to inform us of any thing concerning
lengths or distances.</p>

<p class='c001'>If any change be made upon the value of the money-unit of a
country, which is called a pound; in propriety of language, it can
no more be called a pound, after the change, than it can be called
a rhinoceros.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.15'></a> Farther obscurities from the abuse of language.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>5to</i>, Another reason for the obscurity of money-jargon, is the
manner in which writers express themselves, when they speak of
variations in the value of money. Upon this occasion, says one,
the King raised the money 5 <i>per cent.</i> What does this mean? No
man living can understand the expression; because it may signify,
that he raised either the denomination of the coin, or the value of
the unit. If he raised the coin, he debased the unit: if he sunk the
coin, he raised the unit. A crown of 6 livres is a coin: a livre is
the unit. If it is said, the 6 livre piece is raised; that is as much
as to say, it is made to be more than 6 units; consequently, as the
silver in the piece does not change its weight, it follows, that the
unit, or money of accompt, is diminished. On the other hand, if
it is said that the livre is raised, it implies that the crown, which
contained 6 livres, is made to contain less than 6 units; therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the value of the unit is raised; that is, it is made to contain more
silver than before.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.16'></a> How to avoid such abuse.</div>

<p class='c001'>Writers, therefore, to be distinct, ought never to mention these
matters, without removing the ambiguity, in favour of readers
of all denominations. As for example: The King raised his coin,
and debased his money of accompt. For this reason the French
expression is good, and easily understood; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>augmenter la valeur numeraire
des especes</i></span>, is liable to no obscurity.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are also two terms used by French writers, which appear
synonimous, and yet are directly opposite; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span class='fss'>AFFOIBLISSEMENT</span>, <i>et</i>
<span class='fss'>DIMINUTION</span> <i>de la monnoïe</i></span>. Such terms are perplexing, and ought
either to be avoided, or constantly explained. The first signifies the
coining the specie of the same denomination lighter in the metals
than before: the last signifies the lowering the denominations of
the coin already made. The first therefore diminishes, the second
increases the value of the unit, which is the livre.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.17'></a> Quest 2d. What is the difference between raising the <em>value</em> of coin, by imposing coinage, and raising the denomination of it?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. II.</span> What is the difference between the effects produced
by raising the value of the coin by the imposition of coinage, and
raising the denomination of it? This question is proposed as a further
means of rendering the money-jargon intelligible.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The imposition of coinage, when it gives an advanced
value to coin above the metals it contains, is very different from
that advanced value which the coin appears to receive when the
Sovereign arbitrarily raises the denomination of it; or as the
French call it, when he augments its numerary value.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.18'></a> Answer. The first is real, and affects foreign nations; the other does not.</div>

<p class='c001'>When the imposition of coinage gives an advanced value to the
coin above the bullion it contains, that value becomes real, and
extends itself to foreign nations; that is to say, the coin, so augmented
as a manufacture, must be bought with more foreign coin
than formerly. But when the denomination, or numerary value,
is augmented, the same piece (though augmented in denomination)
is bought by strangers with the same quantity of their coin
as before. An example will make this plain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.19'></a> Proved by an example.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Let us suppose the coin in France, in war time, reduced to the
value of bullion, and that the value of a crown of three livres,
by the course of exchange, should be then worth 29½ pence heavy
silver sterling money; if the balance of the French trade should
become favourable in general, and that coin should become 8 <i>per
cent.</i> dearer than bullion in the Paris market, then the price of
the crown of three livres will rise 8 <i>per cent.</i> upon the London exchange
above 29½ pence heavy silver sterling money, although
there be respectively no balance to be paid in bullion either by
England or France. But let the King of France ordain, that the
crown of three livres shall be raised in its denomination to six
livres, and let the coin at that time be supposed to be at par with
bullion in the Paris market, the crown of three livres will then be
paid as formerly with 29½ pence. That is to say, the augmentation
of the denomination will have no effect upon the value of the
coin in other countries; whereas the augmentation affected by the
operations of trade, in consequence of the imposition of coinage,
is a real augmentation, since it extends to foreign nations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.20'></a> How the arbitrary method of raising the denomination of coin affects prices at home.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now it is certain and evident, that the augmentation of the numerary
value has the undoubted effect of sinking the value of the
numerary unit realized in the coin, and that upon such occasions
we ought to say, that the King has diminished the value of the
livre, and not that he has raised the value of the coin. But the
abuse of language has made people consider the livre as the thing
fixed, and therefore the coin is considered as the thing which rises
and sinks. The consequence of this is, to introduce another abuse
of language. People say, that the prices of commodities rise: I
ask, With respect to what? Not with respect to the pieces of coin,
but with respect to the denominations they carry: that is to say,
with respect to livres; although the livre be considered as the thing
fixed. There is, however, a reason why people express themselves
in this improper manner, which proceeds from the perplexity
and confusion of their ideas concerning money.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>When the King of France arbitrarily changes the numerary
value of his coin, commodities are found, by universal experience,
to stick so closely to the denominations of it, that people are apt
to think that it is the King’s will and pleasure, and not the metal
of which the coin is made, which gives it a value. But commodities
depart from these denominations by degrees, and fix themselves
a-new at a determinate value of the fine metals, proportioned
to what they bear in foreign nations. This is brought about by
the operations of commerce; and consequently, the rise of prices
not taking place till some time after the numerary value of the
coin has been augmented, people accustom themselves to say, that
the augmenting the denomination of the coin raises prices, and
that diminishing the denomination sinks them. But did all prices
strictly adhere to the grains of bullion contained in the coin, and
not to the denominations of the numerary value, then language
would change, and no body would speak about the rising and
sinking of prices, but of the rising and sinking of livres, sols, and
deniers.</p>

<p class='c001'>I hope, from what has been said, that the difference between
raising the value of the coin by imposing coinage, and the raising
the nominal value of it by augmenting the denomination or numerary
value of it, is perfectly understood. The first raises the
value of the numerary unit, by giving a real additional value to
the coin as a manufacture: the last raises, for a while, the value
of the numerary unit; only because the price of commodities,
being attached to the denominations of money of accompt, stick
to them, until the operations of trade reduce them to their true
principle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whenever, therefore, the terms <em>rising</em> and <em>sinking</em> are applied to
value, the thing which is said to rise, is supposed to be the moveable;
and the thing it is compared with, or with respect to which
it is said to rise or sink, is supposed to be the term fixed. Every
one, therefore, who reads books upon this subject, ought, upon
all occasions where there is mention made of rising and sinking of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the price of the gold, silver, bullion, coin, exchange, or commodities,
constantly to cast his eye upon the thing which is supposed
to be fixed, and retaining that in his mind, he will preserve his
ideas distinct.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.21'></a> Quest. 2. How will the imposition of coinage affect the creditors of Great Britain?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. III.</span> Let us suppose that the imposition of coinage, when
properly laid on, will not raise the value of the pound sterling;
and consequently that it will not affect the domestic interests of
Great Britain: it may be asked, What influence that imposition
will have upon the interest of her foreign creditors, since it must
affect exchange?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.22'></a> Answ. If they continue to be paid by denominations, they will gain; if by weight of metal, they will not gain, nor will they lose.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The foreign creditors of the nation will thereby be gainers,
provided their interest continues to be paid in denominations
of pounds sterling, and not in a determinate number of grains of
the fine metals, as was proposed to be done in the fourteenth chapter
of the first part. The reason is plain: upon all occasions, when
coin carries an advanced price above bullion, those who have
funds in England will gain upon exchange. This gain will nowise,
I think, be at the expence of the nation, but at the expence
of those foreigners who have occasion for paper draughts upon
London.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.23'></a> Proved by an example.</div>

<p class='c001'>A creditor of England (in Holland I shall suppose) draws for a
thousand pounds sterling, (the interest of his English funds) a
Dutchman who owes a thousand pounds sterling in London, buys
his bill; must he not pay the creditor of England, not only the
intrinsic value of the bullion contained in the thousand pounds
sterling, but also the difference between the thousand pounds
sterling in coin, and the bullion it contains, according to the
price of it in the London market? This difference then, received
by the proprietor of the English funds, is clear gain to him, and
is no loss to the nation; it is a loss to the Dutchman.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther, every Dutchman who pays his debts to people residing
in England, must suffer the same loss; that is, he must pay the
coinage, which at present the state makes him a present of.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>From this I think it is plain, that while the balance of trade is
favourable to England, or at par, all remittances made by foreigners,
to pay their English debts, must pay the coinage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The operation of this principle has not a little contributed to
facilitate the establishment of the French credit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.24'></a> How the imposition of coinage advances the credit of France.</div>

<p class='c001'>When France borrows, especially in war time, foreigners can
remit to Paris the money they lend nearly at par with bullion.
Then they pay little or no coinage; and when peace is restored,
the coin rising in its value, they gain annually several <i>per cent.</i> upon
their draughts for their interest, to wit, all the advanced value of
the coin, at no loss to France.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.25'></a> Quest. 4. Is the plan we have proposed effectual towards preserving the pound sterling invariable?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. IV.</span> Is the preserving the pound sterling at the mean
value of a determinate weight of fine gold, and fine silver, a sure
method of realizing the unit of money of accompt, so as to preserve
it at all times invariable?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.26'></a> Answ. No; but seems to be the best relative to material money.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> I apprehend it is not; although it seems to be the best
that can be devised, upon supposition that the metals are to be
made use of, as the most proper substance for realizing the scale.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said, in the beginning of this book, that the use of the
scale was to measure the relative value of things alienable. Now
the metals themselves being of the number of things alienable,
and their proportion of value being nowise determined, but liable
to augmentations and diminutions, as well as that of grain or
any other commodity, no scale which is attached to them can
measure any thing but their weight and fineness, and consequently
can be no permanent measure for any thing else.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.27'></a> A scale of value realized in metal can never be exact; because the metal itself varies in its value.</div>

<p class='c001'>Did the value of commodities rise and fall with respect to grains
of the fine metals, in the same proportion that they rise and fall
with regard to one another, the scale would be exact: but if the
grains of metal can acquire an increment, and a diminution of
value, from circumstances entirely peculiar to themselves, such
circumstances must render the scale they compose inaccurate in
proportion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.28'></a>1. From the manufacturing of it.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2. From the interest of money.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>3. From the manners of a people.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Now we have seen how the imposition of coinage enhances the
value of coin. The rising and sinking of the interest of money has
the same effect. The vicissitudes to which credit is liable has a
prodigious influence upon the value of the metals. The manners
even of a people, which can be determined by no principle, operate
the same effect. When people, for example, are given to
hoarding, the metals come to be demanded with more eagerness,
that is, the competition to acquire them is greater; consequently
the value of them with respect to all commodities, is greater than
when they are purely considered as money of accompt.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.29'></a> The only exact scale of value is that which can measure the metals like every other commodity.</div>

<p class='c001'>That scale, therefore, is the only just one, which measuring the
value of the metals, like that of every thing else, renders every individual
of a state equally rich, who is proprietor of the same number
of denominations of specie; whether his wealth be in gold,
silver, or any other property or commodity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.30'></a> Explanation of this proportion</div>

<p class='c001'>Now I agree that, at any given time, this is the case when the
scale is properly attached to the metals; but it is not permanently
so. A determinate property in land bears sometimes a greater,
sometimes a less proportion to a determinate property in money.
When the scale is attached to the metals, he who is proprietor, for
instance, of a thousand denominations in coin, becomes richer or
poorer, according to the fluctuation of the value of that commodity,
the metals. Whereas when the scale is not attached to any
species of commodity, nothing can change his proportion of wealth,
except the augmentation or diminution of the value of the whole
state. This idea is not so distinct as I could wish: let me illustrate
it by an example.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>by an example,</div>

<p class='c001'>Suppose then three partners (A), (B), (C). They form a common
stock by equal shares; (A) contributes a thousand pounds sterling
in current specie, (B) the same value in corn, (C) a like value
in broad cloth. Let me suppose the measures of these commodities
to be expressed by their proper denominations; the metals by
grains, the corn by bushels, the broad cloth by yards. I suppose
that at the end of the year 20 <i>per cent.</i> is gained upon each article
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>of stock; that is, 20 <i>per cent.</i> increase upon the grains of metal, 20
<i>per cent.</i> on the bushels of grain, 20 <i>per cent.</i> on the yards of broad
cloth. This supposition may be allowed. I ask, if it would not be
a much more equal way of dividing this profit, to reduce the whole
value of the grains, bushels, and yards, to the then actual value in
pounds sterling, and so to divide; than if every man were to take his
20 <i>per cent.</i> out of that commodity he had furnished to the co-partnership?
This method of reducing all to a common measure, is
what I understand by an ideal scale of money of accompt.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.31'></a> and by an application to the bank of Amsterdam.</div>

<p class='c001'>The bank of Amsterdam pays none in either gold or silver coin,
or bullion; consequently it cannot be said, that the florin banco is
attached to the metals. What is it then which determines its value?
I answer, That which it can bring; and what it can bring when
turned into gold or silver, shews the proportion of the metals to
every other commodity whatsoever <em>at that time</em>: such and such only
is the nature of an invariable scale.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.32'></a> How the locking up the coin in that bank renders the value of it more stable.</div>

<p class='c001'>I confess I am not capable of analyzing all the complicated operations
of trade in such a distinct manner as to demonstrate how the
universal circulation of value, over the commercial world, should
operate this effect; and how the burying, as it were, a quantity of
gold and silver in a vault, should give a more invariable worth to a
florin, whose value depends upon it, than if the metal itself was to
circulate in coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus far, however, I think I understand, that the impossibility of
profiting of the <em>rising</em> value of one of the metals (which is buried)
ought to find a compensation at all times in avoiding the loss upon
the other, which sinks in its value.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther, the burying the coin both in gold and silver is in a manner
forming these two metals into one mass; this takes away the
variation in the proportion of their value, which principally disturbs
the uniformity of their operation as a scale. They cannot
either be considered as commodities, because they are taken out of
commerce entirely; yet the permanent value of them remains.
Upon that the bank money is secured; but it is not realized in it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>In banks which pay in coin the case is different; because the denominations
in their paper are liable to all the fluctuations incident
to the coin in which they pay. The bank money, therefore, of
Amsterdam is pure money of accompt, and has nothing of merchandize
in it from the metals in the vaults. The paper of all
banks which pay, rises and falls in value, according to the currencies
in which their notes are acquitted.</p>

<p class='c001'>I leave the farther delucidation of this mysterious affair to people
of better capacity, and of more extensive knowledge in those matters
than I can pretend to.</p>

<p class='c001'>To conclude, no material money, let it be contrived as it will, is
exempted from vicissitudes in its value as a metal. This is proved
by the universal risings and sinkings in the price of commodities, in
consequence of circumstances peculiar to the coin. These risings
and sinkings of prices, I say, are properly risings and sinkings of
the value of the coin, and that again is a lengthening and contracting
of the equal parts of the scale of value which is attached to
it. Now there is no such thing as any vicissitudes in the prices <em>of
all commodities</em> with respect to bank money, although nothing is
more common than fluctuations in agio, with respect to current
money; consequently, bank money has a property and a stability
in it, which no material money is capable of acquiring, and for
that reason it is preferable to it, and is properly considered as the
thing fixed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.33'></a> <span class='sc'>Quest. 5.</span> Will not the imposition of coinage in England frequently stop the mint?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. V.</span> Will not the imposition of coinage in England prevent,
upon many occasions, the carrying bullion to be coined at
the mint, when it would be carried were the coinage free?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.34'></a> <span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Certainly; when the balance of trade is unfavourable.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Without all doubt. When coinage is free, every man who
imports bullion runs with it to the mint; there it is proved, cut, and
stamped to his hand, and at no cost. Now to what purpose all this
expence; why carry bullion to be coined, while the balance of
trade is against a nation, since such bullion must be re-exported, together
with a part of the national stock of the metals? Besides, the
coining of it gratis, adds not the smallest value to the metals considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>as a manufacture; consequently, upon the exportation, the
whole price of coinage is entirely lost, and the national stock of
coin is not thereby augmented; nor would it be augmented while
trade is unfavourable, were five hundred mints kept constantly at
work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.35'></a> But this is an advantage to England which France now enjoys.</div>

<p class='c001'>The imposition of coinage, therefore, has these good effects.
First, it prevents bullion from being coined, except when such
coined bullion can remain in the country and augment the national
stock of coin. Secondly, as has been said, it gives an additional
value to the coin, even in foreign countries, and thereby prevents
it from being melted down abroad, in order to be re-coined in other
mints, and thus augment the stock of coin in rival nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>I believe no body ever imports louis d’ors to be coined in the
English mint (notwithstanding of the benefit there is in importing
gold into England from France, where the proportion of the metals
is lower) yet nothing is more common than to carry guineas to
every foreign mint, at the bare price of bullion. This is the reason
why so little English coin, and so much French coin is found
in circulation, in countries foreign to both these nations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.36'></a> The coin of France passes in other nations above its value as a metal, and returns to France unmelted.</div>

<p class='c001'>Louis d’ors, in consequence of the high imposition of coinage
in the French mint, pass current, almost every where, for more than
their intrinsic value, even when compared with the coin of the very
nation where they circulate without the sanction of public authority;
and when that authority regulates their currency, according
to their intrinsic value, such regulation has the same effect as forbidding
them altogether; because the moment a money-jobber lays
his hand upon them at the statute value, he circulates them no
more; but sends them either back to France, or to some country
where they pass, by a conventional value, above their intrinsic
worth. Thus louis d’ors, as well as all French coin, are effectually
prevented from being melted down, and so soon as the balance of
the French trade becomes favourable, they return home.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.37'></a> <span class='sc'>Quest. 6.</span> Is not this return a loss to France?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. VI.</span> Is not this return of louis d’ors to France, upon the
balance of their trade becoming favourable, a loss to France; since,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>in that case, the balance of their trade is paid with a less weight of
bullion than it would be paid with, were their coin worth no more
than bullion; and secondly, because when the coin is exported to
pay the balance, it is exported upon the footing of bullion, and
when it returns it is paid back at an advanced price?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.38'></a> Intricacy of this question.</div>

<p class='c001'>The difficulty of resolving this question proceeds from the complication
of circumstances in which it is involved; and the intention
of proposing it, is to shew how necessary it is, in practice, to
combine every circumstance in political problems.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.39'></a> Resolution of it.</div>

<p class='c001'>I shall therefore observe, that since, at all times almost, French
coin passes (out of France) for more than its intrinsic value, it is
not well possible to suppose that, even during a wrong balance of
the French trade, their coin can ever fall so low as the price of
bullion; consequently the French by exporting their coin, upon
such occasions, above the value of bullion, that nation is a gainer
of all the difference. This operates a compensation of the loss (if
any they sustain) upon the return of their coin. In the second place,
when the balance becomes favourable for France, and when there
is found a profit in sending back the French coin, the demand that
is made for it, by those who want to pick it up in foreign countries,
raises the value of it there in circulation; this again favours
the trade of France, and makes the difference of paying what one
owes to France in bullion at the market price, or in louis d’ors at
the advanced value, very inconsiderable; which consequently prevents
merchants from finding any great advantage in sending back
large quantities of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, when the coin returns, although it has an advanced
value, it has no advanced denomination. It was exported according
to its numerary value, and it returns upon the same footing.
Farther, when the coin returns as the price of French merchandize,
for the same value it bears in the country, I cannot discover
a principle which can make this appear to be a loss to France. The
loss therefore must be upon the exportation of the coin, not upon
the return of it. But we have said that if it be exported at a higher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>value than that of the bullion it contains, this must imply a profit to
France. Consequently, the remainder of loss upon exportation must
be apparent, not real: It is a loss to Frenchmen, who, in exporting
the coin below the full value of it (coinage included) lose a part
of what they had paid the King for the coinage; that is to say, they
lose it so far as they do not draw it back <em>in full</em> from the foreigners
to whom they owe; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> <a id='sn6.40'></a>It is no loss to France.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but it is no loss to France: on the contrary, it is
a gain, as far as any part of the coinage is drawn back; and this
is the case as oft as the coin is exported above the price of bullion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.41'></a> Another view of this question.</div>

<p class='c001'>Or in another view. This going out and returning of the French
coin, may be considered as a loss to France in this respect, that
when the balance of her trade is against her, when her coin loses
of its advanced value in payments made to strangers for the price
of foreign commodities, those who consume such commodities in
France, must consume them at an advanced price to themselves,
but at no additional profit to foreign suppliers; because as to these
last, the French coin, with which we suppose the commodities to
be paid, having lost of its value every where, cannot then purchase
so much as at another time, and consequently is not worth so much
to the foreign supplier who receives it. For the better understanding
of what has been here said, attention is to be had to the difference
there is between a <em>national</em> loss, and the loss sustained by the
individuals in a nation. The balance of trade is the national profit,
or the national loss; but the gains or losses of individuals, may be
compatible with either a right or a wrong balance of the trade of
the nation to which they belong. This will be fully explained when
we come to treat of exchange.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this respect, therefore, France may be supposed to lose upon
exporting her coin, to wit, so far as she consumes foreign commodities
at an advanced value; but then I say, that in this case
France loses the whole price of the commodities, not the advanced
price only; because she loses the balance of her trade. Abstracted
from that, I say she loses nothing. Who loses then the advanced
price? I answer, the consumer of the commodity loses it, and I say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that no body gains it. This is what, in the eighth chapter of the
second book, was called positive loss, and it is owing to the annihilation
of a part of the advanced value of the coin, which the operations
of commerce have effectuated.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these respects only can France be considered as a loser upon
exporting her coin; but in having it returned upon her, when at
an advanced price above bullion, the loss is nothing; because the
advanced price then is a real value added to the coin, and there is
no manner of difference as to France, to receive, for the balance of
her trade, an hundred pounds weight of her own louis d’ors, or an
hundred and eight pounds of standard gold bullion, at such times
as bullion is commonly carried to the mint; because the one and
the other weight of coin and bullion will answer the same occasions
both in the Paris market, and in most trading towns in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these principles we may gather how effectually the imposition
of coinage must prevent the melting down of the coin, providing
a sufficient attention is had to preserve the denominations of
the coin in both species at the exact proportion of the market price
of the metals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.42'></a> <span class='sc'>Quest. 7.</span> If by over-rating gold, the English lose their silver, Why should not France, by over-rating silver, lose their gold?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. VII.</span> The two metals being only valued by one another,
if the English, by valuing the gold higher than the French do,
occasion the exportation of their silver, why should not the French,
by valuing their silver higher than the English do, occasion thereby
the exportation of their gold? And if the English, by over-rating
their gold, prevent the carrying silver to be coined at their mint,
why should not the French by over-rating their silver prevent the
carrying gold to be coined in their mint?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.43'></a> <span class='sc'>Answ.</span> Because the English rate their gold above the value of it in <em>their own market</em>, the French do not so with their silver.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The English over-rate their gold not only with respect to
other nations, but with respect to the value of it in their own market;
whereas the French preserve, in their gold and silver coins,
nearly the proportion between the metals as they are sold in their
own market.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France no body can profit by melting down either of the species,
in order to sell it, with advantage, as bullion; but in England,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>by melting the heavy silver coin, one may sell it in London
for more gold than the same coin not melted can purchase.</p>

<p class='c001'>But here it is objected, that although the proportion between
gold and silver, in the English coin, were set upon a par with that
of the metals in the London market, still one species may be exported
with profit, providing the proportion be different in other
nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is little force in this objection, and were there any, it
would be an additional argument for the imposition of coinage;
because by this the exportation of either of the species, for the sake
of any small difference which may sometimes be found between
the proportion of the metals in the different markets of Europe,
would be prevented. This circumstance however requires a more
particular examination.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a principle in commerce, that the demand for any commodity
raises the value of it; and every nation knows how to profit
of a demand for what they have.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.44'></a> How the proportion of the metals is kept nearly the same in all European markets.</div>

<p class='c001'>Whenever, therefore, one of the metals bears an under value in
one nation, below what it bears in another, that under value makes
that species more demanded by strangers, and it consequently rises
in its value, even at home.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.45'></a> Because when home demand disturbs the proportion, foreign trade brings it even again.</div>

<p class='c001'>By this principle the proportion between the metals in European
markets is kept nearly the same, and the small difference which is
found does not so much proceed from the demand of foreign
trade, as from the taste of the inhabitants. The foreign demand
tends to set the proportion even in all markets, and the internal
demand for one metal preferably to another, is what makes it
vary.</p>

<p class='c001'>The carrying the metals backwards and forwards is attended
with risque and expence; there is not, therefore, so much danger
of a nation’s being stripped of one of its species of current coin by
such a trade, as there is when the proportion of the market price
of the metals is different, at home, from that observed in the coin;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>because in the last case, every one may profit of the disproportion, at
the trifling expence of melting down the rising species.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.46'></a> Coin of gold and silver should be proportioned to the rate of the market at home,</div>

<p class='c001'>From this we may conclude, that nations ought to regulate the
proportion of the metals in their coin, according to the market
price of them at home, without regard to what it is found to be in
other nations; because they may be assured, that the moment any
difference in the market price shall begin to be profited of, that
very demand will alter the proportion, and raise the market price
of the metal sought for by foreigners. While the coin, therefore,
is kept at the proportion of the market at home, and while the denominations
of both species are made to keep pace with it, it will
be utterly impossible for any nation to hurt another by any such
traffic in the metals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.47'></a> and nations cannot fix that proportion by any convention among themselves.</div>

<p class='c001'>We may farther conclude, that it is to no purpose for nations to
agree by treaty upon a certain proportion between silver and gold
in their coins: it is the several market prices every where which
alone can regulate that proportion, and the only method to keep
matters even between them, is to make the denominations in both
species keep an equal pace with the price of the metals in their own
market.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.48'></a> Why is the proportion of the metals so different in England and Asia?</div>

<p class='c001'>Here it is farther objected, that were these principles just, there
would not be found so great a disproportion as there actually is,
between the value of gold and silver in Europe, and in the empire
of China.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this I answer, that the principles are just, and that this difference
proceeds from incidental circumstances which I shall now
point out.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.49'></a> Answer to this.</div>

<p class='c001'>First then, the European trade hardly penetrates into that vast
empire. 2. The lowness of the proportion between gold and silver
is maintained by the high internal demand for silver in China.
3. The India trade being every where in the hands of companies,
there is not so great a competition between the sellers of silver, in
the Chinese market, as if that trade were open to every private adventurer;
consequently the price of it is not so liable to be diminished.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>And last of all, the expence of carrying silver thither, and
the long lying out of the interest, would put a stop to the trade, were
the proportion between the metals to rise in China. This prevents
competition still more between the different European companies,
and consequently prevents the rising of the proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>I need not observe, I suppose, that the term <em>rising of the proportion</em>,
denotes the rising of the price of silver; as when being at that of
1 to 10, it comes, for example, to that of 1 to 11. This term has
been already explained.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.50'></a><span class='sc'>Quest. 8.</span> Is it the interest of Princes to debase the standard of their coin?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. VIII.</span> Is it the interest of Princes to debase the standard of
their coin?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> This question has been already touched upon in the
twelfth chapter of the first part. Perhaps some farther observations
upon it may not be found superfluous.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to set it in a fair light, I shall begin by reducing it to its
ruling principle.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question turning entirely upon the <em>interest</em> of Princes, I shall
take no notice of the iniquity of such a measure with respect to their
subjects; but shall confine it purely to the <em>interest</em> they may have in
exercising this branch of prerogative.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.51'></a> <span class='sc'>Answ.</span> It is their immediate interest to debase it when they are debtors, and to raise it when creditors, but always unjust.</div>

<p class='c001'>I answer then, as I have hinted above, that it is their <em>interest</em> to
debase the standard of their coin when they are in the situation of
debtors; and it is their <em>interest</em> to raise the standard when they are
in the situation of creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Debasing the standard I have explained to be the diminution of the
intrinsic value of the unit below what it was before, either by raising
the denomination, augmenting the alloy, or diminishing the weight
of the coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now since Princes pay their servants by denominations, that is,
by money of accompt, the more they augment the denomination
of the coin they possess, the more they gain upon what they have
at the time. But they lose proportionally upon their revenue ever
after; because the rents and duties levied on their subjects being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>also paid by denominations, the Prince loses every year on his income
what he had gained upon one operation.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we may draw a principle, that Kings who have begun
to debase the standard, ought to go regularly on every year, as
long as they find themselves in the state of debtors; and when they
come to alter their situation, and become of the class of creditors,
it is then their interest to raise the standard. This must be a little
further explained.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.52'></a> Who are debtors and who creditors, and how Princes who incline to rob their subjects may avoid robbing themselves at the same time.</div>

<p class='c001'>It has been abundantly proved, that increasing the denomination,
or debasing the standard, must constantly be advantageous
to the whole class of debtors; consequently, Princes, who are upon
certain occasions obliged to lay out more than they receive, may
then be considered as being of that class. Whoever receives from
another what the other is obliged to pay him, may be considered
as a creditor; whoever gives to another what the other is intitled
to demand of him, may be considered as a debtor. Those, therefore,
who both pay and receive, are, upon the whole, either debtor
or creditor, according to the side which preponderates. He who is
obliged annually to pay more than he annually receives, must be
obliged either to run in debt, to borrow, or to take from a fund
already formed (a treasure). The maxim therefore is, first to fill
the exchequer with the annual income; then to debase the standard;
and last of all to pay. The debts paid, and the current expence
brought within the income; then is the time to raise the standard.
This operation is like that of the ram; he runs back in order to
advance again with more force.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.53'></a> Example of a Prince who is now employing this engine against his enemies, not his subjects.</div>

<p class='c001'>The great master of government and political oeconomy well understands
this doctrine. He is now spending his treasure, not his
income. He is then in the state of the debtors, and accordingly is
regularly every year debasing the standard of the S——n coin. This
debasement, I suppose, regularly takes place after the contributions
for the year are paid. So soon as the war is over, and that this
oeconomical Prince shall return to the state of creditor, he will, I
suppose, suppress the currency of all this bad money, and restore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the standard. That is to say, he has during the war been ruining
all the class of creditors in permanent contracts (the S——n nobility)
and when the peace is re-established their own Prince may
indemnify them, if he pleases, by restoring the former value of
the unit. All sudden revolutions are hurtful; but necessity has no
law<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Writ in the year 1760.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This, in a few words, is, I think, the answer to the question proposed.
Princes have for several centuries, in almost every nation
in Europe, been gradually debasing the standard of their money-unit;
and the debts they have contracted during the debasement
have constantly been an argument against the restoring it. But had
they first regulated all their debts upon the footing of the last debasement,
stipulating with their creditors that they were to be paid
upon the footing of the then currency, that is to say, according to
the French stile, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i><a id='corr66.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='an'>au</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_66.15'><ins class='correction' title='an'>au</ins></a></span> cours du jour</i></span> of the stipulation; they then might,
without any advantage to their creditors, and with great profit to
themselves, have restored the standard, and so prepared the means
of executing the same operation as before, upon a new emergency.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.54'></a> Writers against this practice have used wrong arguments to dissuade Princes from it.</div>

<p class='c001'>Those who have writ against this practice of debasing the standard,
have made use of wrong arguments to dissuade Princes
from following such a measure. They have first represented it as
hurtful to their own interest. This we have seen is not always
true. They have also endeavoured to prove that it is vastly prejudicial
to commerce. This is the great point laboured by Dutot, in
his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Reflexions Politiques sur le Commerce</cite></span>; but to very little purpose.
All the facts and arguments he has produced to prove (by the
source of exchange) that the variations made in France in the standard
value of their crown of three livres did hurt to the trade of
that nation, prove nothing at all, as it would be easy to shew, were
this a proper place. The hurt done to manufactures is greater;
but, in a trading nation, those establishments being under the influence
and direction of merchants, who are perfectly instructed as
to every consequence of such alterations, the manufacturers, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>a very short time, raise their prices to the full proportion of the
increase in the denomination of the coin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.55'></a> The proper arguments against it are three.</div>

<p class='c001'>The real inconveniencies which proceed from this exercise of
power, may be reduced to three.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.56'></a> 1. It disturbs the ideas of a people with regard to value.</div>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, It disturbs the ideas of a whole nation with regard to value,
and gives an advantage in all bargains, to those of the society who
can calculate, over those who cannot.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.57'></a> 2. It either robs the class of debtors or of creditors.</div>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, It robs the whole class of debtors when the standard is raised;
and it robs the whole class of creditors when it is debased.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.58'></a> 3. It ruins credit.</div>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, It ruins credit; because no man will borrow or lend, in a
country where he cannot be sure of receiving back the value of his
loan; or of being in a capacity of clearing himself by paying back
the value he had borrowed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.59'></a> This last circumstance will probably put an end to the practice.</div>

<p class='c001'>This last circumstance has overturned the whole scheme in
France. Princes would go on debasing their standard as formerly,
could they do it and preserve their credit. But who will lend a shilling
to a Prince if he suspects he will pay him back, perhaps, with sixpence?
The Prince above mentioned does not borrow; and as he is
the only one in this situation, he may debase his standard: but
others cannot venture upon such a step.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.60'></a> Quest. 9. What is the best form to be given to coin?</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. IX.</span> What is the best form to be given to coin?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.61'></a> Difference between medals and coins.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Answ.</span> The intention of coinage, <em>for circulation</em>, being to ascertain
the quantity of the fine metals in every piece, and not to represent the
effigies of the sovereign, we see a manifest difference every where
between the impressions struck upon medals, and those of the current
coin: in the first, the head is raised, in the last, it is purposely
made flat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.62'></a> Of indenting the impression.</div>

<p class='c001'>Antiently, the impression put upon some of the English coins was
a cross; which being indented upon the penny, instead of being
raised, occasioned these pieces frequently to be broken into four
parts. This is said to have given rise to the denomination of farthings,
or fourth parts. The indenting the impression upon the
coin, is no doubt a preservative against its wearing; but as it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>liable to other inconveniences, and is so repugnant to custom, it
would be ridiculous, perhaps, to propose it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall reduce, therefore, all I have to propose as a supplement to
what has been said already on this subject, to a very few observations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.63'></a> The less the surface, the wearing is the less.</div>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The less surface any piece has in proportion to its mass, the
less it is worn in circulation; and as all coin is made cylindrical,
that whose form approaches nearest to the cylinder, whose height
is equal to its diameter, must have the least. Coin therefore ought
to be made thick, and for this reason louis d’ors are of a better form
than guineas, and guineas of a far better form than ducats. Were
it easy to give the surface a spheroidal form on both sides, rendring
the coin thicker in the middle than at the edges, the surface would
be thereby a little more diminished.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.64'></a> The advantage of heavy pieces for the greater part of the coin; yet small denominations are useful, in some cases, for preventing the rise of prices.</div>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The great credit of paper in England, is a vast advantage in
many respects. It renders coin less necessary. While that credit
subsists, large payments will always be made in paper; and this
renders the coinage of gold in large heavy pieces less necessary.
The coin, therefore, in England, ought to be calculated for the easy
changing of bank notes, not with a view to the making great payments
in it. For this purpose, two and three pound pieces might be
full as convenient as single guineas, and half guineas might be
proscribed. Small denominations of gold coin lead to expence, and
tend to raise the prices of such commodities as people of fashion
pay immediately out of their own pockets. As for the silver, the
same principles are to be observed. Crown pieces are very convenient
in payments, and have a great advantage over shillings and
sixpences in point of surface. The practice in France of coining the
greatest part of their silver in such pieces abundantly shews how
few of the lesser denominations (that is shillings, &amp;c.) are necessary
for carrying on circulation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.65'></a> Mixt metal better than copper for small denominations, as appears from the practice in Germany.</div>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The copper coin of England is exceedingly bulky, in order
to give it an intrinsic value. This makes many people ashamed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>carry it; consequently increases expence, and raises the price of
many things for the reason already given.</p>

<p class='c001'>What inconveniency could there possibly be in making pence of
a mixed metal of a much lower standard than the other coin. The
coin would be less bulky, and the intrinsic value might be preserved.
This is the custom all over Germany. The lower denominations of
the coin are all of different fineness. The standard for what they
call the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>gros</i></span>; the 7, the 10, the 17, the 20 creutzer pieces, are all
of different fineness; but still in the same sum, in whatever coin it
is paid, according to the laws, there ought to be found the same
quantity of fine silver. This enables them to coin pieces of very
small denominations which have however the same intrinsic value
with the other denominations of the coin, and which are neither of
an unwieldy bulk, or of an inconvenient smallness. This is the regulation
in Germany: I do not say that the regulation is well observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farthings of copper are good and convenient; a few of these
ought always to be preserved in favour of the lower classes of the
people, who thereby are enabled to keep down the prices of the
small necessaries of life: a matter of the greatest importance to a
trading nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nations ought to copy from one another what is good and convenient,
and should be above the thraldom of little prejudices in
favour of established customs, which have frequently nothing but
custom to recommend them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn6.66'></a> Mixed metal never to be bagged up with fine.</div>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, It must be observed that upon adopting the German regulation
as to pence, such coin must not be allowed to be put up in
bags of coin delivered by weight; nor made a legal tender beyond
the value of the lowest silver coin.</p>

  <h4 id='ch7' class='c015'>CHAP. VII. <br /> <i>Of the Regulations observed in France, with regard to Coin, Bullion, and Plate.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It now only remains, that I lay before the reader what I have
been able to gather, upon good authority, concerning the regulations
in some of the principal nations of Europe, with regard to
their mint: and this so far only as is necessary for illustrating our
subject, and confirming the principles we have been laying down.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.1'></a>The marc is the unit of French weight at the mint.</div>

<p class='c001'>The unit of weight in the French mint, is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Marc</i></span>; composed
of eight ounces, every ounce containing 576 grains. The marc
consequently contains 4608 grains of Paris weight, called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>poids de marc</i></span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.2'></a>The remedy of weight upon silver what.</div>

<p class='c001'>By this weight the bullion is delivered to, and the coin is taken
from the workmen in the mint, to whom the King gives an allowance
of 36 grains upon the weight of every marc of coin delivered.
This allowance is called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>le remede de poids</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>A marc therefore of French silver coin, is not to be reckoned at
4608 grains, but at 4572 grains effective.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.3'></a> The standard of fineness is 11 fine to 1 alloy.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Titre</i></span> or title, as the French call it, or the standard of their
silver coin, is 11 parts fine to 1 part alloy. At this rate we shall find
in this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Marc</i></span> of coin, consisting of 4572 grains standard silver, 4191
grains of fine silver, and 381 grains of alloy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.4'></a> Remedy of alloy what.</div>

<p class='c001'>But the workmen have also an allowance of 3 grains upon the
fineness, which introduces a new equation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mass of silver in the French mint (when we speak of the
fineness) is supposed to be divided into 12 deniers, and every denier
into 24 grains; which, in this acceptation, are both denominations
of proportion, not of weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Any mass of silver, therefore, of whatever weight, must be supposed
to contain 12 × 24 = 288 grains of proportion; consequently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>were the standard exactly 11 deniers fine, the proportion would be
marked thus, 264 grains fine, to 24 alloy; but since there is an
allowance of 3 grains of proportion, called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>le remede d’alloy</i></span>, this
brings the proportion to be as 261 is to 27. This is the exact standard
of French silver coin, and answers to 10 deniers and 21 grains
fine, which is the term used in the mint.</p>

<p class='c001'>To find, therefore, the number of grains of fine silver in a marc
of the French silver coin, we must state this proportion, 288 : 261
:: 4572 : 4143.38.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.5'></a> Quantity of fine silver in a marc, as delivered at the mint.</div>

<p class='c001'>The marc, therefore, of coined silver, after all deductions for
alloy, and for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>remede de poids</i></span>, contains of fine silver 4143.38 grains
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>poids de marc</i></span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.6'></a> Into what coined.</div>

<p class='c001'>This <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>marc</i></span> is coined into 8 great crowns and <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub> of a crown, value
in the coin 49 livres, 16 sols.</p>

<p class='c001'>If therefore 4143.38 grains of fine silver, be worth 49 livres 16 sols,
4608 grains (or a marc of fine silver) will be worth 55 livres 6 sols
9 deniers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.7'></a> Mint price of a marc of fine silver.</div>

<p class='c001'>But the mint price of fine silver is 51 livres 3 sols 3 deniers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference, therefore, between the mint price of fine silver,
and the price of it in the coin, will shew exactly the expence of
coinage; consequently there is withheld for the expence of coinage
and duty of seignorage (all which deductions and impositions
are called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>le trait des monnoyes</i></span>) 4 livres 3 sols 6 deniers upon
every marc of fine silver. To know how much this makes <i>per cent.</i>
state it thus,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><a id='corr71.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='55.162'>51.162</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_71.26'><ins class='correction' title='55.162'>51.162</ins></a></span> : 55.38 :: 100 : 108.2.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.8'></a> The price of coinage 8⅕ per cent. upon silver.</div>

<p class='c001'>So that in France there is 8.2 <i>per cent.</i> deducted upon the coinage of
silver, as has been said. Let us next examine the regulations as to
the gold.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.9'></a> Remedy of weight upon gold.</div>

<p class='c001'>The marc, as above, is the unit of weight for the gold, and contains,
as has been said, 4608 grains, of which 15 grains are allowed
to the workmen for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Remede de poids</i></span>: remains of standard gold
in the marc 4593 grains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.10'></a> The fineness of standard gold.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The fineness is reckoned by carats (not a weight, but a denomination
of proportion) for the gold, as the denier is for the silver. Fine
gold is said to be, as in England, of 24 carats. The carat is divided
into 32 parts, so 32 × 24 = 768, are the parts into which any given
mass of gold is supposed to be divided, when we speak of the standard
fineness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.11'></a> The remedy of alloy upon gold.</div>

<p class='c001'>The standard of French gold is the same with that of silver, to wit,
<sup>11</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>, or 22 carats fine. Upon this the workmen are allowed <sup>12</sup>⁄<sub>32</sub> parts of
a carat, for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Remede d’alloy</i></span>; which reduces the standard to 21<sup>0</sup>⁄<sub>32</sub>
carats fine, to 1<sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>32</sub> carats alloy. This expressed according to the
division above mentioned, stands thus, 692 parts fine to 76 alloy.</p>

<p class='c001'>To find, therefore, the number of grains of fine gold in a marc
of the coin, we must state the following analogy.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>768 : 692 :: 4593 : 4138.48.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.12'></a> The marc into what coined.</div>

<p class='c001'>The marc of gold coin therefore contains, after all deductions,
4138.48 grains of fine gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>This marc is coined into 30 louis d’ors of 24 livres each, value in
all 720 livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>If therefore 4138.48 grains of fine gold be worth in the coin 720
livres, the marc of fine gold, or 4608 grains, will be worth 801
livres 12 sols.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.13'></a> Mint price of a marc of fine gold.</div>

<p class='c001'>But the mint price of fine gold is 740 livres 9 sols 1 denier.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference, therefore, between the mint price of fine gold,
and the worth of it in the coin, (viz. 61 livres 3 sols 2 deniers) will
shew exactly the price of coinage.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we ask how much this makes <i>per cent.</i> we may state it thus,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>740.409 : 801.68 :: 100 : 108.2.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.14'></a> The price of coinage 8⅕ per cent. upon gold.</div>

<p class='c001'>So in France there are 8.2 <i>per cent.</i> deducted for coinage of the
gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the foregoing calculations it appears, that the King takes
above 8 <i>per cent.</i> upon the coinage both of gold and silver.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.15'></a>Which no way stops the mint.</div>

<p class='c001'>For many years past there have been no violent methods used to
bring bullion to the mint, and yet we see, by the dates upon the
French coin, what great quantities have been struck both of gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and silver. This is a most convincing proof, I think, that the imposition
of coinage, when properly laid on, is no interruption to
the mint; and being a matter of fact well determined, is a confirmation
of that principle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.16'></a> Of the proportion of the metals.</div>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine the proportion between the value of the
metals, both in the coin and at the mint.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this purpose we must compare the mint prices in one equation,
and the value of the gold and silver coin in another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.17'></a> How to discover it.</div>

<p class='c001'>At the mint, a marc of fine silver is paid 51.162 livres, and a marc
of fine gold 740.409 livres; consequently 51.162 : 740.409 :: 1 : 14.47.</p>

<p class='c001'>A marc of fine silver, in the coin, is worth 55.38 livres; a marc
of fine gold, in the coin, is worth 801.68 livres. We may therefore
state thus, 55.38 : <a id='corr73.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='801.61'>801.68</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_73.13'><ins class='correction' title='801.61'>801.68</ins></a></span> :: 1 : 14.47.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.18'></a> The proportion is as 1 to 14.47.</div>

<p class='c001'>The proportion, therefore, both at the mint and in the coin is
the same; and is nearly as the French writers state it, to wit, as
1 is to 14<sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>19</sub>, but more exactly as 1 to 14.47, which is very nearly
as 1 to 14.5.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.19'></a> Gold contained in a louis d’or, and silver in a crown of 6 livres.</div>

<p class='c001'>From these computations we find the exact quantity of fine gold
in a louis d’or, and of fine silver in a great crown, or piece of 6 livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the louis d’or there are 137.94 grains fine, and 153.1 standard
gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the great crown there are 499.22 fine, and 550.843 standard
silver.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.20'></a> Proportion of a French grain weight to a troy grain.</div>

<p class='c001'>Farther, by the most exact calculations I have been able to make,
after comparing the accounts which French writers give of the proportion
of the English troy grain, with the grain of the Paris pound,
and the accounts which English writers give of the proportion of
French grains, with those of the troy pound; and after checking
these accounts with the most accurate trials, by weighing and
taking a mean proportion upon all, I find that a French grain <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>poids
de marc</i></span>, is to an English grain troy, as 121.78 is to 100. See the table.
What a shame it is, that such proportions can only be guessed at
by approximations, in the age in which we live!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>To discover, therefore, the number of troy grains of fine gold in
a louis d’or, state thus, 121.78 : 100 :: 137.94 : 113.27.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.21'></a> Proportion between the louis and the guinea.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now a guinea contains 118.651 troy grains of fine gold, and yet,
in almost every country in Europe, the louis d’or, in time of peace,
passes for as much as the guinea, when both are of good weight.
This is a matter of fact well known, and is a confirmation of another
principle which I have laid down, to wit, that the imposition of
coinage gives an advanced value to a nation’s coin, even in foreign
countries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.22'></a> Of the fineness of French wrought plate.</div>

<p class='c001'>The fineness of the French silver wrought into plate, is different
from that of the coin. The fineness of the coin we have said to be
10 deniers and 21 grains, or 261 parts fine, to 27 alloy; and the
value of a marc of it (when the 36 grains of remedy of weight is
deduced) is 49 livres 16 sols, which makes the full marc of 4608 grains
to be worth 50 livres 4 sols. The standard of the plate is 11<sup>0</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub> deniers,
or 274 fine, and 14 alloy. In order, therefore, to find the value
of the plate, at the rate of the coin, state thus, 261 : 50.2 :: 274 : 52.7;
consequently silver plate in France, at the rate of the coin, is worth
52 livres 14 sols.</p>

<p class='c001'>When goldsmiths sell their plate, they ought regularly to charge,
for the metal, the current price of the market; but as that is constantly
varying, the King, for their encouragement, has fixed the
value of the marc of it at 52 livres, which is only 14 sols per marc
below the value of the coined silver, including the price of coinage.
Consequently, were goldsmiths to melt down the coin in order to
make plate of it, they would lose 14 sols per marc, besides the expence
of reducing the melted coin to the standard of the plate.
Goldsmiths, therefore, in France, will never melt down the coin
when they can find bullion in the market, at the price of 14 sols per
marc below the value of the coin; and we have seen that the price
imposed on coinage generally reduces the bullion to near 8 <i>per cent.</i>
below coin: but supposing them to melt it down, there is no loss to
the state, because the coinage is already paid.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.23'></a> Goldsmiths profit by the imposition on coinage,</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>By this regulation, goldsmiths profit by the imposition of coinage;
because the mint price of silver being 8 <i>per cent.</i> below the
value of the coin, and that keeping the price of bullion low, goldsmiths
gain upon the sale of their wrought plate, all the difference
between the price they pay for bullion when they make their provision
of it, and the price they are allowed to sell it at when wrought.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another consequence of this regulation is, that there is no competition
occasioned between the mint and the goldsmiths, to the
prejudice of the latter. No body will carry bullion to the mint
while there is the least demand for it to make it into plate. This
consequence is plain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.24'></a> And never find the mint in competition with them for the metals.</div>

<p class='c001'>Bullion can never fall lower than mint price; consequently, the
mint may rather be considered as receiving the bullion upon an
obligation to pay a certain price for it, than as demanding it in the
market. The smallest demand, therefore, from the goldsmith, will
raise the price of bullion when it stands at mint price; because he
who has it, will never give it to any body who has occasion for it,
without some small advantage above what the mint must give him
for it; but the mint price being fixed, no competition can come
from that quarter, and therefore the advanced price the goldsmith
gives must be very small.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.25'></a> Advantages of the French regulations.</div>

<p class='c001'>Upon the whole, the regulations in France appear (so far as I
comprehend them) admirably well contrived to serve every purpose.
They prevent the melting down and exporting of the coin;
they prevent bullion from being coined, when it cannot remain in the
kingdom; they give an advanced value to that part of the nation’s
coin which must be exported for the payment of the balance of
trade; and they recall it home when the balance becomes favourable.
They prove an encouragement to the industry of goldsmiths;
there is a sufficient check put upon their melting down the specie;
and there is no discouragement given to private people from making
plate, because the silver in the plate is sold by the goldsmith, a
small matter below its intrinsic worth when compared with the
coin.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The only thing to be reformed is the remedies allowed by the
King upon the weight and fineness; because it tends to perplex
calculations, and is not at all necessary. When exactness can be
procured, it ought to be procured; and as the workmen regularly
profit of all the remedies allowed them, it is a proof that they
have no occasion for any indulgence to make up for their want of
dexterity.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall make no mention of the duty of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>controle</i></span> upon wrought
plate. This I consider as an excise upon a branch of luxury; consequently,
the examination of it belongs to the doctrine of taxation,
and is foreign to that of money.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been said above, that the imposition of coinage (occasioning
the coin of France to circulate, almost at all times, above its
intrinsic value as bullion, even in foreign countries) prevented bullion
from ever rising in the Paris market to the price of coin. This
principle I also find confirmed by facts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.26'></a> High price of bullion in the Paris market during the year 1760.</div>

<p class='c001'>Foreign gold of 22 carats fine, sold in the Paris market (December
13th, 1760) at 712 livres the marc. In order to find the value of
the marc of fine gold, state thus, 22 : 712 :: 24 : 776.7. Now the
marc of fine gold in the coin, we have seen to be 801.12 sols. So at
this time, when France is engaged in a most expensive war, while
she is daily exporting immense quantities of both gold and silver
coin, to pay her armies and subsidies, the price of gold bullion in
her market is 24 livres 18 sols per marc below the value of her
coin. Nothing but the advanced value of her specie in foreign currency,
could possibly produce such a phænomenon. But when she
was sending stamped ingots of gold to Russia, in the month of September
last, the price of the gold bullion of 22 carats then rose to
734 livres per marc, which for the marc of fine gold makes 800
livres 14 sols, which is but 18 sols below the value of the coin.
The reason is plain: the coin sent to Germany, or Holland is constantly
returning to France, or at least may soon return, which supports
the high price of it in these countries; but what was sent to
Russia was plain bullion.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Before I conclude this chapter, I must say a word concerning the
wearing of the French coin by circulation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn7.27'></a> Present state of the wearing of the French silver coin.</div>

<p class='c001'>As paper money has no currency in France, by any public authority,
all payments must be made in coin. For this purpose the silver
is more commonly used than the gold; from which I am obliged
to conclude, that the silver must be somewhat over-rated in the coin,
above the proportion of the price of gold in the Paris market; but
of this I have no exact information.</p>

<p class='c001'>The silver coin is put up in sacs of 200 great crowns, value 1200
livres. This sum on coming out of the mint, weighs, according to
the following equation, 23 marcs 7 ounces 152 grains. State thus,
8.3 great crowns = 4572 grains standard silver; consequently,
200 = 110168.6 = 23 <a id='corr77.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='marks'>marcs</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_77.13'><ins class='correction' title='marks'>marcs</ins></a></span> 7 ounces 152 grains.</p>

<p class='c001'>These sacs, according to my information, weigh constantly at
least 23 marcs 7 ounces, exclusive of the sac; so that the French
silver currency has not, at this time, lost above 152 grains upon
the sac of 1200 livres, which is about <sup>137</sup>⁄<sub>1000</sub> per cent. This is a trifle
upon a small sum; but as no difference, however small, is a trifle
upon a large sum, a limit ought to be set to the farther diminution
of the weight of the currency, which might be accomplished easily,
by ordering all sacs of 1200 livres to be made up to the weight of
23 <a id='corr77.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='marks'>marcs</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_77.22'><ins class='correction' title='marks'>marcs</ins></a></span> 7 ounces effective, for the future. This would be, at
present, no injury to the public, there would be a sufficient allowance
given for many years circulation of the coin, and the degradation
of it in time coming, would be effectually prevented.</p>

  <h4 id='ch8' class='c015'>CHAP. VIII. <br /> <i>Of the Regulations observed in Holland, with regard to Coin and Bullion.</i></h4>
</div>

<div  class='c007'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.1'></a>Present state of the Dutch currency.</div>

<p class='c001'>It comes next in order to examine how this matter stands in the
states of the United Provinces, and with this I shall conclude.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall here find the question infinitely more involved in combinations,
than hitherto we have found it. We shall find the most
sagacious people in the world, with regard to trade and money,
struggling with all the inconveniencies of an ill regulated coinage,
and an old worn out silver currency; carrying on their reckonings
by the help of agio; weighing their specie; giving allowance for
light weight; buying silver with silver, and gold with gold; as if
it were impossible to bring the value of these metals to an equation;
and loading commerce with an infinity of brokers, Jews, and
cashiers, without the aid of which it is impossible in Holland either
to pay or to receive considerable sums in material money.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is very true that what must appear an inextricable perplexity
to a stranger, is really none at all to the Dutch. Trade is there so
well reduced to system, and every branch of it so completely furnished
with hands to carry it forward, that the whole goes on mechanically,
and though at a great additional expence to trade in general,
yet at none to the merchant; because he regularly sums up
all this extraordinary expence upon his dealings, before he superadds
his own profit upon the operation. Were therefore all this
unnecessary expence avoided, by a proper regulation of the coin,
the consequence would be, to diminish the price of goods to strangers,
as well as to the inhabitants, to leave the profits upon trade,
relative to the merchants, exactly as before; and to increase, considerably,
the trade of the republic, by enabling them to furnish all
commodities to other nations cheaper than they can do, as matters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>stand; but were this plan put in execution, the consequence would
also be, to take bread from all those who at present live by the disorder,
which ought to be removed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Of the regulations in the Dutch mint.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.2'></a> Regulations in the Dutch mint.</div>

<p class='c001'>The unit of weight in the Dutch mint, is the marc <em>Holland’s troes</em>,
or gold weight.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.3'></a> Their unit of weight is the marc Holland’s troes.</div>

<p class='c001'>This weight is about 1½ <i>per cent.</i> lighter than 8 ounces English
weight, without coming to the most scrupulous exactness.</p>

<p class='c001'>This marc is divided into 8 ounces; every ounce into 20 engles;
every engle into 32 aces or grains. The ounce therefore contains
640, and the marc 5120 aces. By this weight, bullion is bought,
and the coin is delivered at the mint, or weighed in circulation,
when weighing is necessary.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.4'></a> The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>remede</i></span> of weight on silver.</div>

<p class='c001'>The mint delivers the silver coin by the marc weight; but from
the full weight, there is deducted as a <em>remedy</em>, one engles and one
ace, or 33 aces: so the marc of the mint, by which they deliver the
silver, contains 5087 aces, in place of 5120.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.5'></a> The fineness of silver is different in different coins.</div>

<p class='c001'>The fineness of the Dutch silver is various, according to the species.
I shall here, for the greater distinctness, take notice only of
the fineness of the florins; because it is the best and the most standard
coin, used in the payments of foreign bills of exchange, leaving
the other varieties of their specie to be considered afterwards.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.6'></a> Florins are <sup>11</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub> fine with one grain of remedy.</div>

<p class='c001'>By florins I mean (besides the florin pieces) those also of 30 stivers,
and the 3 florin pieces, the standard of which is all the same, to
wit, <sup>11</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub> fine with one grain of remedy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.7'></a> How they reckon their silver standard.</div>

<p class='c001'>The mass of silver in the Dutch mint, (when we speak of the fineness)
is supposed to be divided into 12 pence, and every penny into
24 grains, as in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>Any mass of silver, therefore, of whatever weight, is supposed
to be divided into 288 parts; consequently by <sup>11</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub> fine with one
grain of remedy, is meant, that there are 263 of these parts <em>fine</em>,
and the remaining 25 parts of <em>alloy</em>. This is the exact standard of
the Dutch florins.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>To find therefore the number of grains of fine silver in the marc
weight, as it is delivered at the mint, we must state this proportion,
288 : 263 :: 5087 : 4645.4.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.8'></a> Exact quantity of fine silver in a marc weight of Dutch florins as they come from the mint.</div>

<p class='c001'>The marc therefore of coined silver florins, after all deductions
for alloy, and for remedies of weight and of fineness, contains of
fine silver 4645.4 aces Hollands troes.</p>

<p class='c001'>This marc is ordered to be coined into 23<sup>7</sup>⁄<sub>331</sub> florins. If therefore
4645.4 aces of fine silver be worth 23<sup>7</sup>⁄<sub>331</sub> or (in decimals, for the
sake of facilitating calculation) 23.2024 florins, then the full marc
or 5120 aces of fine silver will be worth 25.572 florins by this analogy,
4645.4 : 23.2024 :: 5120 : 25.572.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.9'></a> Mint price of fine silver.</div>

<p class='c001'>But the mint price of the marc of fine silver is 25.1 florins. The
difference, therefore, between the mint price of fine silver, and
the price of it in the coin, will shew exactly the expence of coinage.

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>25.1 : 25.472 :: 100 : 101.48</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.10'></a> Price of coinage in Holland is about 1½ <i>per cent.</i> on silver.</div>

<p class='c001'>So that in Holland there is not quite 1½ <i>per cent.</i> taken upon the
coinage of silver florins. Let us next examine the regulations as to
gold coin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.11'></a> Of the Dutch gold coins.</div>

<p class='c001'>There are in Holland two species of gold coins of different
weights, fineness, and denominations, to wit, the <em>Ducat</em> and the
<em>Rider</em>; we must therefore examine them separately.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.12'></a> The ducat has no legal denomination.</div>

<p class='c001'>The ducat is what they call a <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>negotie pfenning</i></span>, that is, a coin struck
under the authority of the state, in all the mints, and of a determinate
weight and fineness; but not a legal money in payments,
because it has no <em>legal</em> denomination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ducats are delivered by the marc weight as the silver; but there
is a remedy of weight deducted of one engle per marc. So the
marc of ducats, as delivered by the mint, weighs but 5088 aces.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.13'></a> The fineness 23 carats 8 grains.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The fineness of the ducats is (as in the empire) of 23 carats 8
grains; but in Holland they allow one grain of remedy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.14'></a> How the fineness is reckoned.</div>

<p class='c001'>The standard of the gold is reckoned by carats and grains: 24
carats are called fine gold, and every carat is divided into 12 grains;
so let the mass of gold be of what weight soever, it is always supposed
to contain 288 parts, that is, 12 × 24: at this rate the fineness
of ducats is 283 parts fine gold, and 5 parts alloy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.15'></a> Fineness of the ducats of the empire.</div>

<p class='c001'>The imperial ducats ought to be 284 parts fine, 3 parts silver, and
one part copper, without any remedy; but in Holland the assayers
bring the gold to the fineness of 23 carats and 8 grains; then they
suppose that what remains is all silver, and they take their remedy
by adding one grain of copper. Dutch ducats are therefore something
in the fineness, though nothing in the weight below the
regulations of the empire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.16'></a> Exact quantity of fine gold in a marc weight of Dutch ducats as they come from the mint.</div>

<p class='c001'>To find the number of grains of fine gold in the marc weight,
as it is delivered from the mint, we must state this proportion,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>288 : 283 :: 5088 : 4999.6.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The marc, therefore, of gold coined into ducats, after all deductions
for alloy, and for the remedies of weight and fineness, contains
4999.6 aces of fine gold. This marc is ordered to be coined
into 70 ducats.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, 4999.6 aces of fine gold, be worth 70 ducats, then
the full marc of 5120 aces of fine gold will be worth 71.687 ducats,
by this proportion, 4999.6 : 70 :: 5120 : 71.687.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.17'></a> Mint price of fine gold.</div>

<p class='c001'>But the mint price of the marc of fine gold is 71 ducats.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference, therefore, between the value of a marc of fine
gold in ducats, and the price given by the mint for the same quantity
of fine gold bullion, shews the expence of coinage. State thus,</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>So that there is not quite 1 <i>per cent.</i> taken in Holland upon the
coinage of their gold ducats.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.19'></a> The price of coinage upon both species should be the same.</div>

<p class='c001'>But upon the silver florins there is (as we have seen) near 1½ <i>per
cent.</i> consequently, there is an encouragement of 1½ <i>per cent.</i> given
for carrying gold to the mint preferably to silver; which, in my
humble opinion, is ill judged. I allow that the expence of coining
a sum in silver is greater than the expence of coining the same sum
in gold; but I think it is better to allow an additional profit to the
mint upon the gold, than to disturb the equality of intrinsic value
which ought to be contained in the same sum coined in gold and
silver. But indeed, according to the present state of the Dutch mint,
this small irregularity is not much to be minded, as we shall see
presently.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.20'></a> The Rider</div>

<p class='c001'><em>Riders</em> are a coin but lately used in Holland. Formerly, the
Dutch had no legal gold coin, silver was their standard; and ducats
as a <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>negotie pfenning</i></span> (as they call them) found their own value, having
no determinate legal denomination, as has been said.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.21'></a> has a legal denomination, and is a lawful tender in payments to ⅓ of the sum,</div>

<p class='c001'>But of late the States have coined this new species of gold, to
which they have given a fixed denomination, and the authority of
a legal coin, to be received in all payments, so far as one third of
the sum to be paid; the other two thirds must be paid in silver:
but of this more afterwards, our present business being to examine
the weight, denomination, and fineness of this species.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.22'></a> is coined always by the state and for the state; so there can be no mint price.</div>

<p class='c001'><em>Riders</em> are coined by the State alone, no private persons carrying
bullion to the mint for that purpose; the coinage, therefore, not
being open to the public, it is in vain to seek for a mint price.
They are delivered at the mint by tale, not by weight; so we must
inquire into the statute weight, fineness, and denominations of this
species, in order to discover the quantity of fine gold which is contained
in the florin of this currency: this we shall compare with
the florin in the ducat, and so strike an equation between the florin
in this standard coin, and in the other, which finds its own price,
according to the fluctuation of the metal it is made of.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.23'></a> Regulations as to the fineness, denomination, and weight of riders.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>A marc of fine gold struck into riders circulates for 374 florins.
This is the regulation as to the weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>The standard is exactly <sup>11</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub> fine, or 22 carats, without any remedy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The denomination is 14 florins for every rider, the half rider in
proportion. To discover therefore the quantity of fine gold in a
rider, we must first divide 374 by 14, which will give the number
of riders in the marc fine, viz. 26.714 riders; then we must say, if
26.714 riders contain a marc of fine gold, or 5120 aces, how much
will one rider contain? The answer is <sup>5120</sup>⁄<sub>26.714</sub> = 191.65.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.24'></a> Quantity of fine gold in a florin of riders.</div>

<p class='c001'>Divide this by 14, and you have the number of aces of fine gold
contained in a florin of this currency, <sup>191.65</sup>⁄<sub>14</sub> = 13.69.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here then is the exact weight of the fine gold contained in one
florin of the currency in riders.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.25'></a> To put the ducat upon a par with riders it should circulate for 5 florins 4⅛ stivers.</div>

<p class='c001'>Let us now examine how much a ducat ought to pass for, in order
to be upon a par with the currency of the riders.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen that a marc of fine gold is coined into 71.687 ducats.
That number of ducats, therefore, to be upon a par with the
riders, should be worth 374 florins. Divide, therefore, this last
number by the first, you have <sup>374</sup>⁄<sub>71.687</sub> = 5.217 florins, which is a little
more than 5 florins 4⅛ stivers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.26'></a> Utility of not fixing the denomination of ducats.</div>

<p class='c001'>Were the States, therefore, to give a fixed denomination to ducats,
they ought to be put at that value; but the trade of Holland
requires that this coin should be allowed to fluctuate, according to
circumstances. The great demand at present (1761) for <em>gold</em> to send
to the armies preferably to silver, on account of the ease of transportation,
has raised the value of that metal, perhaps ¼ <i>per cent.</i>
above what it would otherwise be. If then ¼ <i>per cent.</i> be added, it
will bring the ducat to the present current value, to wit, 5.4⅜ florins.
If, therefore, in order to bring the currency of ducats upon a par
with the riders, they were fixed at 5.4⅛ florins, it is very plain, that
no more would be sent away in payment at that rate, because of
the present advanced value of gold; consequently, none would be
coined; the mints would be stopped, and the armies would be paid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>in guineas and Portugal gold; the melting and recoining of which
keeps all the mints in Holland in constant occupation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, besides employing and giving bread to a number of hands,
multiplies the Dutch currency, at a time when they have so great
occasion for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine the proportion of the metals in the coin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.27'></a> How to find the proportion of the metals in the coin of Holland, and a wonderful phænomenon in the value of ducats.</div>

<p class='c001'>Here we must adhere closely to the regulations of the mint above
mentioned, and only determine what the proportion of the metals
would be, were the coin of Holland, both gold and silver, of standard
weight, and were it the practice to pay for the metals at the
mint, indifferently in either species. But neither of these suppositions
are to be admitted: First, because the silver coin is not of its
due weight; and in the second place, because the mint never buys
gold bullion but with gold coin, nor silver bullion but with silver
coin. This is the infallible consequence of a coinage ill regulated
in what relates to the proportion of the metals, which ought respectively
to be put into the same sum, in the two different species.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be endless to examine the proportion of the metals, with
respect to every species of their coin. It would also be incorrect to
examine it as to the ducats; because that species has no fixed legal
denomination; and the proportion of the metals is to be discovered
by the denomination of the coins only.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ducats pass current among the people for 5 florins 5 stivers; but
with merchants, who buy them as merchandize, their value is continually
varying. At present (September 1761) the new coined
ducats brought in bags from the mint, which never have circulated,
are bought for 5 florins 4⅝ stivers; those which have circulated
(were it for a day) fall, from that very circumstance, to 5 florins
4⅜ stivers; which is a diminution of near ¼ <i>per cent.</i> of their
value. This phænomenon shall afterwards be accounted for.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.28'></a> Were all the coin of full weight, the proportion would be as 1 to 14.62.</div>

<p class='c001'>This being the case, we have no method left to judge of the proportion
of the metals in the coin of Holland, but by the proportion
of fine gold and fine silver found in the same sum, paid in florins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of full weight, and in new riders; the one and the other coined
according to the regulations of the mint above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been shewn that a marc of fine gold in riders, circulates
for <i>f.</i> 374, and that a marc of fine silver in florins, circulates for
<i>f.</i> 25.572; divide the first by the last, you have the proportion as
1 to 14.62: But we shall afterward discover a circumstance, not
taken notice of in this place, which will reduce the proportion
lower.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.29'></a> Quantity of fine silver in a florin piece.</div>

<p class='c001'>From the above calculations, we may easily discover the exact
quantity of fine silver and fine gold contained in a Dutch florin,
whether realized in silver florin pieces, in gold riders, or in ducats.
As this will be of use when we come to examine the par of exchange,
it will not be amiss to set before the reader, the exact state
of that particular before we proceed. We have said that whoever
receives <i>f.</i> <a id='corr85.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='24.572'>25.572</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_85.15'><ins class='correction' title='24.572'>25.572</ins></a></span> in silver florins of full weight, receives a marc of
fine silver, which contains 5120 aces. Divide the last sum by the
first, you have 200.21 aces of fine silver for the florin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.30'></a> Quantity of fine gold in a florin of riders.</div>

<p class='c001'>Whoever receives <i>f.</i> 374 in gold riders, receives a marc of fine
gold, which contains 5120 aces. Divide the last sum by the first,
you have 13.69 aces of fine gold for the florin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.31'></a> Investigation of this proportion as to the ducat;</div>

<p class='c001'>We have seen that ducats fluctuate in their value, having no
legal denomination, which obliged us to state the current value of
a marc of them at 71.687 ducats, not being able to express that
value in florins; because of the unsettled denomination of that species.
Let us now specify that value in florins, upon three suppositions.
The first, that the ducat is worth what it passes for among
the people, to wit, 5<i>f.</i> 5<i>st.</i> The second, at the value of new ducats
from the mint, to wit, 5<i>f.</i> 4⅜<i>st.</i> The last, at the merchant
price of good ducats, which have circulated, to wit, 5<i>f.</i> 4⅜<i>st.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>In the first case (the ducat at 5<i>f.</i> 5<i>st.</i>) 71.687 ducats are worth
376.35 florins, this being the value of a marc of fine gold in ducats,
and the marc containing 5120 aces; divide the last by the first, you
have 13.604 aces of fine gold for the florin.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>In the second case (the ducat at 5<i>f.</i> 4⅝<i>st.</i>) 71.687 ducats are worth
375.04 florins; by which number divide 5120 as before, you have
13.651 aces of fine gold for the florin.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the last case (the ducat at 5<i>f.</i> 4⅜<i>st.</i>) 71.687 ducats are worth
374.11; by which number dividing 5120, you have 13.685 aces of
fine gold for the florin, which comes within a trifle of the florin in
riders.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.32'></a> by which it appears that the late war has raised the value of gold, and set the market price of the metals in Holland at 1 to 14.785.</div>

<p class='c001'>But now (in June 1762) I learn, that the course of new ducats
from the mint in the Holland-market, is got up to 5<i>f.</i> 5½<i>st.</i> <a id='corr86.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='in'>In</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_86.9'><ins class='correction' title='in'>In</ins></a></span> this
case, 71.687 ducats are worth 378.1 florins; by which number
dividing 5120, as before, you have 13.541 aces of fine gold for the
florin.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we seek here the proportion between the gold and silver, we
must state thus. If a florin in ducats contain 13.541 aces of fine
gold, and a florin in silver coin contain as above 200.21 aces of fine
silver, then 13.541 : 200.21 :: 1 : 14.785. So the effect of this war has
already been to raise the value of gold 1.12 <i>per cent.</i> above what it
was esteemed to be, when the riders were coined.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proportion as to riders is, as before, 1 to 14.62.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.33'></a> Which is a rise upon the value of gold of 1.12 per cent.</div>

<p class='c001'>The present proportion as to ducats is 1 to 14.785.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>14.62 : 100 :: 14.785 : 101.12.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I must farther observe upon this subject, that although we have
seen that the ducats which have circulated for ever so short a while,
when bought at 5<i>f.</i> 4⅜<i>st.</i> produce for the florin 13.685, (which is
more than is produced by the new coined ducats fresh from the
mint) we are not from this to conclude, that the former are intrinsically
a cheaper currency than the latter. I have been at all the
pains imaginable to weigh these ducats against others fresh from
the mint; and also to compare their weight with what it ought to
be by the regulation; and I have constantly found near ¼ <i>per cent.</i>
difference between them. This is entirely owing to the nature of
the coin. The ducat has a large surface in proportion to its weight;
it carries a very sharp impression, full of small points; the cord
about the edges is exceedingly rough; so that the least rubbing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>breaking off those small points, diminishes the weight of the <a id='corr87.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='price'>piece</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_87.1'><ins class='correction' title='price'>piece</ins></a></span>
near ¼ <i>per cent.</i> which is clear loss, not only to the proprietor, but
to the state, and to all the world. Besides, those who are obliged
to go to the mint for new ducats, are supposed to bear the greatest
weight of the coinage of a piece which, having no legal denomination,
is left afterwards to seek its own value, according to that
of the metals at the time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.34'></a> The intention of this minute detail is in order to calculate the real par of the coins of Europe.</div>

<p class='c001'>As I have entred into this minute detail of the weight of fine
silver and fine gold contained in the Dutch florins, with a view to
facilitate the calculation of the par of the metals contained in the
coins of Holland, and those of other nations; I must next mention
the proportion between the aces in which we have expressed the
weight of the Dutch specie, and the grains in use in some of the
principal nations with which they trade: These I take to be England,
France, and Germany.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.35'></a> Proportion between the mint weights of Holland, England, France, and Germany.</div>

<p class='c001'>The reduction of weights to mathematical exactness, is beyond
the art of man; and to this every one, who ever tried it, must subscribe.
I have been at all the pains I am capable of, to bring those
weights to an equation; and here follows the result of my examination
into that matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>By all the trials and calculations I have made, I find that 5192.8
aces Holland-troes; 3840 grains English troy weight; 4676.35
grains Paris poid de marc; and 4649.03 grains Colonia (which is
the gold weight of the empire) are exactly equal.</p>

<p class='c001'>I reckon by the lowest denomination of these several weights, to
wit, their grains; to avoid the endless perplexity of reducing to a
proportion, their pounds, marcs, and ounces, which bear no regular
proportion to their grains.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.36'></a> Par of a pound sterling, in weighty silver, with Dutch florins in riders is 11 florins 12 stivers.</div>

<p class='c001'>To give some examples of this method of calculating the exact
par of the metals contained in the coin of those nations, reduced
to the weights of Holland, I shall state the following computations.</p>

<p class='c001'>A pound sterling in silver, by the statute of the 43d of Elizabeth,
is 1718.7 grains troy fine; to know how many aces Holland-troes
that makes, state thus, 3840 : 5192.8 :: 1718.7 : 2324.1.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Divide 2324.1 by 200.21, (the number of aces contained in a silver

</div>

<p class='c001'>Divide 152.8 by 13.69, (the number of aces contained in a gold
florin in riders) you have for the par of the pound sterling in guineas,
<i>f.</i> 11.161.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.38'></a> Par of a French louis d’or with the same florin, is 11 florins 3 stivers and ¾.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Divide 153.17 by 13.69, (the number of aces contained in a gold
florin in riders) you have for the par of the louis d’or, <i>f.</i> 11.188.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.39'></a> Par of 24 livres French in silver with the same florin, is 11 florins 1½ stiver.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.40'></a> Great balance of trade against France, in September 1761.</div>

<p class='c001'>The French silver here is less valuable in Holland than the gold:
this is no proof that the proportion between the metals in the respective
coins of these two nations is different (we shall soon find it to
be very exactly the same); but this preference in favour of the
French gold, is owing to the temporary demand for gold on account
of the war; for which reason no French silver coin appears at present
in Holland. I write in September 1761.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must also observe, that at this time the course of louis d’ors is
11<i>f.</i> 4<i>st.</i> which is little or nothing above the real par of the metal
they contain; which in peaceable times is not the case. This
proves how strongly the balance of trade is against France with
respect to Holland, as it has reduced her specie to the price of bullion:
it is not so in Germany.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.41'></a> Low value of the pound sterling in Holland, in 1761.</div>

<p class='c001'>The low value which a pound sterling has borne for these several
years in exchange, and the great fall of its worth in Holland of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>late, when it has been at 10<i>f.</i> 10<i>st.</i> is no argument against the
high conversion I have given it, to wit, above 11<i>f.</i> 12<i>st.</i> Were
there nothing but silver coin in England, and were it all of standard
weight, exchange would frequently run even above that value
in peaceable times; because the silver coin in Holland is light, and
I have reckoned it as if it were of full weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will be observed, that the par upon the gold does not quite
amount to 11<i>f.</i> 4<i>st.</i> the reason of which is the great disproportion
in the British coin, between the intrinsic value of a pound sterling
in silver, and in gold, when both are of standard weight; the latter
being near 5 <i>per cent.</i> worse than the former, when the proportion
of the metals is supposed to be at 14½. But at present there are
no sterling pounds in silver money; there is no silver in England in
any proportion to the circulation of trade; and therefore the only
currency by which a pound can be valued, is the guinea.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.42'></a> Owing to the lightness of the gold coin in England at that time,</div>

<p class='c001'>It has been said, and I think sufficiently proved, that the price of
the metals in the market, shew very exactly the weight of the currency
in nations where coinage is free, when there is no severe
prohibition (<em>put in execution</em>) against the exportation of the coin. This
I take to be the case in England. Now gold there has risen of late
to 4<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per ounce; from which I conclude, that the guineas
with which it is bought, or with which bank notes are paid,
are at present so light, that 4<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> of them do not weigh
above an ounce, (the good guineas are exported) whereas an ounce
of new guineas is worth no more than 3<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>Gold, therefore, which now sells for 4<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> would certainly
be worth no more than 3<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i> were English gold coin
of its proper weight: and the price of it will come down to that
value, in proportion as circumstances shall call back the heavy
guineas.</p>

<p class='c001'>To facilitate the verification of this point, I shall first observe, that
the difference between 4<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and 3<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i> is 4.57 <i>per cent.</i>
The English gold currency, therefore, at the time standard bullion
was worth 4<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> must have been worn 4.57 <i>per cent.</i> Guineas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>when of full weight, weigh 129.43 grains of troy weight;
if such guineas are worn 4.57 <i>per cent.</i> they ought to weigh no more
than 123.23 grains troy. Now let any man try the experiment, and
put an old guinea, taken by chance (not picked out) into a scale,
and see whether it has not been worn down to 123.23 grains; and
let him also examine whether the <em>greatest part</em> of the guineas, at the
time when gold bullion has got to so high a price, are not of King
George I. and his predecessors: these I call old.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides these there are other circumstances to be attended to.
Men who job in coin, pick up all the worst guineas they can when
they go to market; or if they buy with paper, we may decide, that
the bank at that time pays in guineas not above the weight of
123.23 grains troy; for if the bank paid with guineas of a greater
weight, he who had occasion to carry his paper to market to buy
gold bullion, would certainly rather go to the bank, and afterwards
melt down their guineas. Were the bank of England never to pay
but in gold of full weight, and were the exportation of guineas
free, it is impossible that gold should ever rise above the mint price,
which is 3<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>As a farther confirmation of the justness of the high valuation I
have put upon a silver pound sterling of standard weight, I shall observe,
that a new guinea passes in Holland (at the time when the
exchange is at 10<i>f.</i> 10<i>st.</i>) for 11<i>f.</i> 11<i>st.</i> and every body knows,
that such a guinea in England is not above the intrinsic value of a
silver pound sterling of full weight. If then I can get 11<i>f.</i> 11<i>st.</i> for
a new guinea, I ought to get as much for a new silver pound sterling,
since the intrinsic value of both is the same, when the proportion
of gold to silver is as 1 to 14½. Now this guinea must be
worth more than 11<i>f.</i> 11<i>st.</i> because the Jews, who carry them to
the mint, give that price for them (I have disposed of them to Jews
at that value<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a>); and as the coinage of ducats costs, as we have
seen, near 1 <i>per cent.</i> the guinea is intrinsically worth 2 stivers more,
that is 11<i>f.</i> 13<i>st.</i> but as gold at present bears an advanced price
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>upon account of the war, and that the proportion between gold
and silver is in Holland above 1 to 14½, these are the reasons why
the guinea, in Holland, is at present something above the intrinsic
value of a silver pound sterling, which we have stated at <i>f.</i> 11.609,
a trifle above 11<i>f.</i> 12<i>st.</i></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. This was writ in Holland.</p>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.43'></a> and not to the wrong balance of their trade, as is alledged.</div>

<p class='c001'>Let me here observe, by the bye, that all the pounds remitted
from Holland to England, for filling the subscription for 12 millions
of last year, cost the remitters but about 10<i>f.</i> 10<i>st.</i> for the pound
sterling. If this low course of exchange be owing (as some pretend)
to a wrong balance of trade against England, and not (as I pretend)
to the lightness of the gold currency; then we must allow, that the
expence of the German war (which is what alone carries off coin
out of the kingdom) must have exceeded all the profits of the English
commerce, which I apprehend to be at present immense; and
also all the money lent by foreigners towards the loan of 12 millions.
I leave to others more knowing than myself, to determine if such
a supposition be admissible. If it be rejected, let any man reflect
how absurd it would be to raise, at this time, the standard of the
pound sterling to the old value; and to repay at 11<i>f.</i> 12<i>st.</i> such
sums as have been borrowed at the value of 10<i>f.</i> 10<i>st.</i> or in other
words, to make a present to the Dutch creditors of above 11 <i>per
cent.</i> upon account of a loan for a year or two.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.44'></a> Defects of the silver currency of Holland.</div>

<p class='c001'>Having now given as good an account as I can of the Dutch coin,
according to the regulations of the state, I shall next point out the
defects of their silver currency, and shew the consequences which
result from them. As for the gold, it is at present perfectly well
regulated. The riders are all exact in their weight, fineness, and
denomination; the ducats are all now recoined of legal weight and
fineness; and the denomination not being fixed, they serve, in a
trading nation, as a merchandize, of which the weight and fineness
are well ascertained. The only defect, therefore, I can discover
in the Dutch gold currency, is the form of the pieces. They have
too much surface in proportion to their weight, and the impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>is too sharp; both which contribute greatly to the wearing of the
coin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.45'></a> Account of this currency.</div>

<p class='c001'>The silver currency of Holland is of two sorts. The bank species,
and the current species. Here it must be observed, that by
bank <em>species</em> is not meant Amsterdam <em>banco</em>, or bank money, but
certain coins which are called <em>bank species</em>. These are,</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
<colgroup>

    <td class='c011'>—————</td>
    <td class='c019'>20 stivers.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c001'>These are called <i>groff gelt</i>, as being the good specie, of which
hitherto we have only spoken. Sums to be paid in bank species,
must be composed of ⅔ of this currency, and of ⅓ of what follows,
viz.</p>

  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li>Riders of 14 florins.
    </li>
    <li>Dutch half crowns of 28 stivers.
    </li>
    <li>Ses t’halves of 5½ stivers.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c001'>I have put in the riders, though a gold coin, in order to give a
compleat enumeration of all the kinds of these bank species.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.46'></a> Regulations for the payment of foreign bills in coin.</div>

<p class='c001'>Foreign bills drawn on Rotterdam in banco (i. e. bank species)
are often received <em>there</em>, in any of the above species, without regard
to the ⅔ which ought to be groff gelt; but when the holder of the
bill desires the acceptor (which the latter cannot refuse) to write it
off to his credit in the current bank of Rotterdam, and that he has
there no stock, then, if he brings in specie to the bank, it must be
as above specified.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.47'></a> Ditto for current bills.</div>

<p class='c001'>Current bills, not specified by the word <em>banco</em>, are generally paid
according to the following proportion:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub> in schillings of 6 stivers.
    </li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub> in dubleties of 2 stivers.
    </li>
    <li><sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub> in good silver.
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class='sidenote'>Ditto for merchandize.</div>

<p class='c001'>Merchandize are paid with all kinds of Dutch silver, ⅒ only in

to agreement.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.48'></a> The denominations of the several silver currencies not proportioned to their intrinsic value.</div>

<p class='c001'>From this exposition of the matter, it is very evident, that all
these currencies must be of different intrinsic values, in proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>to their denomination; otherwise, why all this trouble about regulating
the proportion to be received in payments? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cause of this.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This proceeds
from two causes: first, from the wearing of the pieces; the second,
from the disproportion of the fineness in pieces of the same weight
and denomination.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.49'></a> Regulations concerning the weighing of silver species in banks current.</div>

<p class='c001'>As to the first, to wit, the wearing of the coin, I shall observe,
that the three denominations of the good silver, to wit, the 3 guilder
pieces, the 30 stiver pieces, and the 20 stiver pieces, are put up
promiscuously in the same bags; being of the same fineness, and
consequently of the same value, in proportion to their weight.
These bags contain 600 florins each, and the legal and full weight,
with which they are weighed at the bank current of Rotterdam, is
25 marcs 5 ounces and 10 engles. Now the exact weight of a florin,
according to the regulation, is, as we have said, 200.21 aces fine;
then the 600 florins ought to weigh <a id='corr93.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='1201.26'>120126</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_93.15'><ins class='correction' title='1201.26'>120126</ins></a></span> aces fine, which at the
standard of 263 parts fine to 25 alloy, is 131545 aces standard: by
this analogy, 263 : <a id='corr93.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='120120'>120126</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_93.17'><ins class='correction' title='120120'>120126</ins></a></span> :: 288 : 131545; which is equal to 25 marcs
5 ounces 10 engles and 13 aces. So the weight at the bank is but
13 aces lighter than in strictness it ought to be; which is so small a
difference, that it could hardly turn a scale with such a weight suspended
in it: for which reason, I suppose, it is left out, for the
sake of the even reckoning of 25 marcs 5½ ounces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did these bags of silver coin come up to the full weight, then the
silver currency in Holland would be good as to those pieces; but as
the greatest part of them are old, having been struck with the hammer,
and are of unequal weight, having been coined (<em>al marco</em>) in
the old fashion, when coin was weighed by the marc, and not as
at present piece by piece, it is impossible they should be of legal
weight: the bank, therefore, allows 2 ounces of remedy in receiving
those sacs, that is, they put 2 ounces into the scale with the
sac, and if they find that the sac is still light, but that the deficiency
does not exceed one ounce more than the remedy, they throw out
the coin and reckon it over; and if the tale be just, and that none
of the pieces appear to have been clipped, they receive it as if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>were of due weight: if it prove above 3 ounces short of the just
weight, they do not receive it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.50'></a> All allowances for light weight are an abuse.</div>

<p class='c001'>Here is a palpable abuse, from a disorder in the coin. If a sac
is ever so little too light, why allow it to pass, as if it were of due
weight? Nothing is so easy as to order such deficiency to be made
good by the deliverer. Weights are made for exactness, and all
remedies are aukward and incorrect.</p>

<p class='c001'>This allowance must open a door to malversations in a country
like Holland, where there is almost no milled silver coin. The old
hammered money was not weighed at the mint, as has been said,
piece by piece: it was sufficient that every marc of it answered to
the legal denomination: under such a regulation, it is very plain,
that there must be many pieces above the legal weight, as well as
many pieces below it. Is it to be supposed that money-jobbers will
not profit of that inequality, by reducing the heavy pieces to their
standard weight, when by such an action they cannot be convicted
of any crime? This is one abuse.</p>

<p class='c001'>By reducing the heavy pieces to their legal weight, the currency
is degraded; because that which is taken from these ought to be
left to compensate what the light pieces fall short. The bank,
therefore, by giving the remedy, gives a kind of sanction to this
malversation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.51'></a> Frauds of money-jobbers in Holland.</div>

<p class='c001'>Farther, if a money-jobber gets some sacs above the current
weight, is it to be doubted but he will reduce them as near as he
can to the lowest weight received at the bank? And if he should
mistake, and reduce them too low, he has still an expedient for
cheating the public, which shall be mentioned presently.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.52'></a> The best silver coin in Holland is, upon an average, 1 per cent. too light.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now let us suppose, that the specie we are speaking of is, upon
an average, only 2 ounces <i>per</i> sac below the standard. If it be no
more, this circumstance does great honour to the money-jobbers.
Such a deficiency, however, amounts to within a mere trifle
of 1 <i>per cent.</i> Is not this an object of great importance, upon all
the silver specie of Holland; especially as the remedy given by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>current bank, is a tacit permission given to every body who has address,
to rob so much from all the weighty coin?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.53'></a> From which it follows, that the actual proportion of the metals in their coin is as 1 to 14.479.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now let us, by the way, correct the former calculation we made
upon the proportion of the metals in the Dutch coin. We said
above, that a marc of fine gold in riders circulated for <i>f.</i> 374, and
that the same weight of silver circulated for <i>f.</i> 25.572, which gave
for the proportion 1 to 14.62; but here we find that the marc of
silver has lost by fraud and wear 1 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>Now the marc of silver being 5120 aces, if they have lost 1 <i>per
cent.</i> there will remain 5068.8 aces. If these 5068.8 aces, therefore,
circulate for <i>f.</i> 25.571, the full marc must be worth in the
coin <i>f.</i> 25.83.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order then to find the exact proportion of the metals in the
Dutch currency, we must divide 374 by 25.83, instead of dividing
by 25.572, as we did when we supposed the silver of full weight.
Now <sup>374</sup>⁄<sub>25.83</sub> is = 14.479. So the proportion is as 1 to 14.479, the
same, within a trifle, of that received in France; which is as 1 to
14.47. But if we attend to every circumstance, we shall find the
proportion still lower than the last calculation makes it; for in
that, we have searched for it with respect to the best silver specie
in Holland; whereas we ought, in strictness, to calculate the gold,
against a mixture of ⅓ of less valuable specie, with ⅔ of the good:
but when computations cannot be brought to perfect exactness,
it is better not to attempt a calculation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.54'></a> Another abuse in the silver coin of Holland.</div>

<p class='c001'>Before I leave the consideration of the inequality in the weight
of the Dutch currency, I must take notice of another circumstance
of considerable importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>No payments made in silver, below <i>f.</i> 600, are subject to be
weighed; any more than what circulates without being put up
in bags. What restraint, therefore, is there laid upon money-jobbers,
with respect to this part of the currency? When these gentlemen
have occasion for money bagged up, they take care that such
specie shall be of the proper weight to pass at the current bank,
and as for all that is light, they either employ it in payments below
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><i>f.</i> 600, or throw it into the common circulation. This circumstance
presents us then with two sorts of silver currency in Holland;
that which is bagged up, and weighty; and that which is
not, and light.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we consider the trade of Holland, and the prodigious quantity
of payments made in current money, we shall find the quantity
of silver which circulates in loose pieces very small, in proportion
to that which is bagged up: the regulation therefore of
weighing the bags is of infinite importance; and were it not for
that, the currency would be debased in a very short time. But the
cashiers, who are the great depositaries of this currency, being
obliged to deliver the bags of the legal weight, they are thereby
restrained from tampering with it: and the bagging up, greatly
preventing the wear, supports tolerably well the weight of this old
currency of hammered money.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.55'></a> Reason of the great apparent scarcity in Holland of silver coin.</div>

<p class='c001'>To people who do not attend to all these circumstances, there
<em>appears</em> a prodigious scarcity of silver currency in Holland. It is
there as difficult to get change for ducats, as it is in England to
get change for guineas; and yet, upon examination, we shall
find, that the intrinsic value of the silver coin, commonly given in
exchange for the gold species, is far below the value of the gold.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.56'></a> A paradox to be resolved.</div>

<p class='c001'>Here then is a paradoxical appearance to be resolved; to wit,
How it can happen in trading nations, such as England and Holland,
that in the exchanging light silver coin for weighty gold
coin, people should be so unwilling to part with the silver, although
really of less value than the gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the case in both countries: thus it happens in England,
where there is so little silver currency; and the case is the same
in Holland, where there is a vast deal. Let me therefore endeavour
to account for these political phænomena.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since the time I composed the former part of this inquiry into
the principles of money and coins, I have found, by the trials I
made in Holland upon the weight of the English silver currency,
that shillings are at present (1761) far below the weight of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>65</sub> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>a pound troy, which is what they ought to be, in order to make
21 of them equal in value to a new guinea, according to the present
proportion of the metals. It is therefore demanded,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, How it comes about that such shillings do not debase the
value of the English standard below that of the gold?</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, Why are they so difficult to obtain, in change even for new
guineas, which are of more intrinsic value every where? And,</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, Why money-jobbers are not always ready to give them in
exchange for new guineas?</p>

<p class='c001'>These appearances seem inconsistent with the principles above
laid down; and a reason must be given why these principles do
not operate their effect in this example.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><a id='sn8.57'></a> Solution of it.</div>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that circumstances are infinite, and must constantly be
attended to; and there are in the case before us several specialities
not to be overlooked; I shall therefore point them out, in my answers
to the three questions, as they lie in order.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the first, I answer, that these shillings are in so small a
quantity, in proportion to the gold species, that they cannot be
employed in <em>payments</em>. Now it has been said above, that <em>exchange</em>
(in trade) regulates the value of the pound sterling, and considers
it as a determinate value, according to the combination of the intrinsic
worth of all the several currencies, <em>in proportion as payments
are made in one or the other</em>. Now (generally speaking) no commercial
obligations are acquitted in silver. I do not understand by the
word <em>payments</em>, a few pounds sterling sent from farmers in the
country, perhaps in payments of their rents to their landlords;
nor what falls into the public offices, in the payment of taxes. It
is trade alone, and the payment of bills of exchange between different
countries, which can ascertain the true value of that
currency in which mercantile payments are made. Were these
worn-out shillings in such plenty as to allow bills of exchange to
be acquitted in them, I make no doubt but they would fall below
the value of the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>21</sub> of new guineas; every one would be
glad to dispose of them for guineas, at the rate of their currency;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and guineas, then, would be as difficult to be got for silver,
as silver is now to be had for guineas. This would bring the
standard still lower than it is at present; that is, below the value of
the gold: but as payments cannot be made in shillings, their currency
cannot affect the standard.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second question is, Why they should be so difficult to obtain
in change for guineas, which are above their value?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that it is not the intrinsic worth of the light shillings
which makes them valuable, and difficult to be got; but the
utility they are of in small circulation, forces people to part with
their guineas for a less valuable currency. These shillings I consider
(now) as <em>marks</em>, not as material money, fitted to a standard.
Every body knows the difference between <em>marks</em> or <em>counters</em>, and <em>specie
of intrinsic worth</em>. The copper coin of most nations is marks, and passes
current, although it does not contain the intrinsic value of the
denomination it carries; nor ought it to be a legal tender in payments
above a certain sum. Such a regulation preserves its usefulness
for small circulation, and prevents it, at the same time, from
debasing the standard, and involving in confusion the <em>specific currency</em>
(as I may call the gold and silver coins) when properly proportioned,
and of just weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>But shillings in England, although they be at present in a manner
no better than marks, because of their lightness; yet in the
eye of the law they continue to be lawful money, and a legal tender
in payments. It is therefore of great consequence that such
shillings be not in too great plenty. That would have been the
case, had government come in to the plan proposed for the coinage
of shillings below the standard; such shillings would have been
coined abroad, and run in upon England, to the great detriment
of the nation; and although they had been proscribed in payments,
beyond a certain sum, yet they would have been so multiplied in
small payments, as to have furnished a means of buying up the
gold coin, and carrying it out of the country for an under-value.
Whereas the worn shillings do not produce that bad effect, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the scarcity of them, and from the impossibility of imitating them
in foreign mints<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. It is commonly believed that shillings are coined at Birmingham, and that government
winks at the abuse, because of the great scarcity of silver in England. I find no
foundation for this belief, after the inquiry I have made.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, Mr. Harris, who was the best assay-maker in Europe, told me,
that a bag of those shillings had been sent to the mint by the Lords of the Treasury,
to be tried by him: that he had found them to be English standard, to the most scrupulous
exactness: that he did not believe any such correct assay could be made, except
at the mint: that all the engravers of the mint declared it was impossible to imitate a
worn shilling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The trials I myself made were of a different nature. I examined the shillings with
a magnifying glass; and found almost every one different in the impression, as well as
in the weight. In some the back-part of the head was worn, in others the face: none,
in short, were worn perfectly alike.</p>

<p class='c001'>I put a handful of them into a coal fire; and taking them out when red-hot, and
throwing them on the hearth, I plainly discovered, on many of them, some part of
the arms of Great Britain appearing in the cross upon the reverse, in a different colour
from the ground of the coin: in others indeed nothing could be seen: this was owing
to the degree of wearing. How then can any dye strike an impression upon a coin,
which answers all these appearances?</p>

<p class='c001'>I communicated to Mr. Harris the trials I had made, and he was perfectly satisfied,
upon the whole, that no old shilling had ever been counterfeited at Birmingham.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The answer to the third question, viz. Why money-jobbers are
not always ready to give old shillings for new guineas? is easy,
from what has been said. They cannot pick them up below the
mean value of the currency; because of the great demand there
is for them in exchange for guineas; therefore they can gain nothing
by providing them for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>It comes next in order, to solve a similar phænomenon in Holland,
where there are great quantities of silver specie, and yet one
can hardly find change for a ducat, except in a shop, where one
has occasion to buy something.</p>

<p class='c001'>This mystery is easily resolved. The great quantities of silver in
Holland consist of what is put up in bags of due weight, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>to the regulations mentioned above. This part of their currency
is about ½ <i>per cent.</i> better, in intrinsic value, than ducats at
5<i>f.</i> 5<i>st.</i> tale for tale; which is a sufficient reason not to part with
it, in change for ducats at that rate. But besides this bagged up
bank specie, there are many other sorts of old worn-out coin,
of unequal weight and fineness.</p>

<p class='c001'>These serve as marks for the small circulation, and are not a legal
tender in all payments; such as foreign bills. What is the consequence
of this? Since this old specie carries denominations above
its value, when compared with the bagged-bank-silver coin, it
serves to buy up this good silver, when it falls into circulation;
that is, it serves to buy up, or to exchange, florin pieces, which
are, as I have said, ½ <i>per cent.</i> better than ducats at 5<i>f.</i> 5<i>st.</i> Such
good silver pieces are not very common in ordinary circulation;
but as it frequently happens that people receive silver in sacs, for
their daily expence, who do not mind the difference of ½ <i>per cent.</i>
when they pay in this good money, it circulates for a little time,
until it falls into the hands of those who know it, and bag it up
again. Thus it happens in Holland, from the disorder of their
coin, that you may be paid a million sterling, if you please, in
good silver coin; and yet you find difficulty to procure silver for a
ducat, in the lightest, basest, and most aukward pieces imaginable
for reckoning. The bad consequences resulting from this disorder,
have been taken notice of in the proper place.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='large'>PART I.</span> <br /> OF THE INTEREST OF MONEY.</h3>
<hr class='c014' />

<h4 class='c015'>INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p class='c016'>I come now to inquire into the principles of credit; a subject
already introduced in the 27th chapter of the second book,
where I examined the nature of circulation, and pointed out the
principles, which direct a statesman when and how to retard or
accelerate its activity, according as the political interests of his
people may require.</p>

<p class='c001'>In that chapter the object was, when and how either to extend or
restrain the use of credit, according to political circumstances. The
question now comes to be, what that credit is; upon what it is
founded; what the various species of it are; what the methods of
establishing and extending it, while in its infancy and vigour; how
to sustain it when overstretched; and last of all, how to let it fall as
gently as possible, when by no human prudence it can be longer
supported?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Many political writers in treating of credit, represent it as being
of a very mysterious nature; owing its establishment to a confidence
not easily accounted for, and disappearing from the slightest unfavourable
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>That credit, in its infancy, is of a very delicate nature, I willingly
allow; as also that we have many examples which confirm the
sentiments of those who believe it to contain, in itself, something
very mysterious: but this proves no more, than that, in such cases,
credit (as I consider it, and as it will appear really to be) has not
been properly established. The cause of confidence has had nothing
in it but opinion, and when this is the case, credit is but a
shadow; a thin vapour, which may be dissipated by the smallest
breath of wind.</p>

<p class='c001'>They all agree that credit is no more than confidence, but they
do not examine how that confidence is to be established on a solid
foundation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The operations of credit are incompatible with the involved contracts
of the law, and with the spirit of intricate land-securities.
The policy of such contracts was analogous to the manners of the
times which gave them birth. Trade is a late refinement, in most
nations of Europe, and industry is still a later: the beginnings of
both are slow, imperceptible, and obscure. The instruments by
which they are promoted, are the lower classes of a people; such
individuals appear to be of very small consequence; and yet it is
by the accumulation of many small things only, that this huge
fabric is erected.</p>

<p class='c001'>To establish that credit, which is necessary for carrying on so
great a work, a statesman must lend his hand. He must give a
validity to mercantile obligations, which have no name in his law
books: he must support the weak against the strong: he must reform
the unwieldy procedure of courts of justice: he must facilitate the
sale of property: he must establish the credibility of merchants
books regularly kept: he must discourage frauds, and support fair
dealing.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>When such a plan is once established, confidence will find a basis
in the property of every individual who profits by it. When it is
not established, credit will appear like a meteor: intelligent and
crafty men will avail themselves of it, and thereby dazzle the eyes
of the public, with gilded schemes of opulence and prosperity: mankind
will fly to industry, confidence will be established; but as
there will be no method of determining the bounds of that confidence,
the promoters of the scheme will profit of the delusion:
confidence will vanish; and the whole will appear to have been a
mystery, a dream. Is not this a representation of many projects set
on foot since the beginning of this century? What were the South
Sea’s and Missisippi’s, but an abuse of confidence? Had ever the
<em>cause</em> of confidence been examined into, would ever such extravagant
ideas have arrived at the height they did?</p>

<p class='c001'>Credit therefore must have a <em>real</em>, not an <em>imaginary</em> object to support
it; and although I allow that in all operations of <em>mercantile</em>
credit, there must be something left to chance and accident; yet
that chance must bear a due proportion to the extraordinary profits
reasonably to be expected from the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this it appears, what an useful speculation it is to inquire
properly into the nature of credit; to deduce with accuracy the
principles upon which it is founded; to banish mystery from plain
reason; to shew how <a id='corr103.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='every'>even</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_103.23'><ins class='correction' title='every'>even</ins></a></span> the most surprizing effect of credit,
whether tending to the advantage, or to the hurt of society, may
easily be accounted for; and, which is the most useful of all, to
point out how such effects may be foreseen, so as either to be improved
or prevented.</p>

<p class='c001'>In going through so extensive a subject, as a deduction of the
principles of credit, method is very necessary; and when a detail
is long, subdivisions are very convenient. I have, upon this account,
divided this book into four parts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first shall be set apart for deducing the principles which regulate
the rate of interest; because this is the basis of the whole.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The second, for the principles of banking; under which I shall
have an opportunity to unfold the whole doctrine of domestic circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third, for those of exchange; which is equally well calculated
for carrying on foreign circulation; and as to what regards
debts, and the borrowing of money, with all the consequences
which they draw along with them, these important objects will
furnish ample matter for</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth and last part, which shall treat of the principles of
public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>These premised, I proceed to the definition of credit.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
  <h4 id='ch4.1.1' class='c013'>CHAP. I. <br /> <i>What Credit is, and on what founded.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Credit is the <em>reasonable expectation entertained by him who fulfills
his side of any contract, that the other contracting party will reciprocally
make good his engagements</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>To illustrate this, we may say with the lawyers, that as all contracts
may be reduced under one of the following heads, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Do ut des,
do ut facias; facio ut des, facio ut facias</i></span>; so he who actually gives or
performs his part, is the creditor, or the person who gives credit;
and he who only promises to give or perform, is the debtor, or the
person who receives it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Credit, therefore, is no more than a <em>well established</em> confidence between
men, in what relates to the fulfilling their engagements.
This confidence must be supported by laws, and established by
manners. By laws, the execution of formal contracts may be enforced:
manners, alone, can introduce that entire confidence which
is requisite to form the spirit of a trading nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Credit, in its infancy, must be supported by statutes, and enforced
by penalties; but when it is once well established, every
recourse had to law, is found to wound the delicacy of its constitution.
For this reason we see, that in certain nations, the legislator
wisely excludes the ordinary courts of justice from extending
their rigid jurisdiction over mercantile engagements: they
leave to the prudence and good faith of men versed in commerce,
to extricate the combinations which result from such transactions;
because they are to be interpreted more according to the constant
fluctuation of manners, than to the more permanent institutions of
positive law.</p>

<p class='c001'>The more the jurisdiction of the statesman is unlimited; or in
other words, the less the power of any sovereign is restrained, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the laws and constitution of the state he governs, the more it behoves
him to avoid every step of administration which can make
his authority be felt in cases where credit is concerned. If he should
happen, for example, to be a debtor himself, he must take good
care never to appear in any other light to his creditor. The moment
he puts on the sovereign, the same moment all confidence is
lost. For these reasons, we have hitherto had few examples (I
might perhaps have said none at all) where credit has been found
<em>permanently</em> solid, under a pure monarchy.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we must observe, at the same time, that the stability of credit
is not incompatible with that form of government. At certain
times, we have seen credit make a surprising progress in France;
and it has never suffered any check in that state, but from acts of
power, which I think have proceeded more from inadvertency, and
want of knowledge, than from a design of defrauding creditors.
These may be looked on as blunders in administration; because
they have constantly disappointed the purpose for which they were
intended. Let me prove this by some examples.</p>

<p class='c001'>The arret of 21 May 1720, (of which we shall give an account
hereafter) destroyed in one day the whole fabric of credit, which
had been erected in France during the course of three years; and
which in so short a time had mounted to a height hardly credible.
I say, that in one day this inadvertent step (for no real injury was
intended) destroyed the credit of 2,697,048,000 livres of bank notes,
(above 120 millions sterling) and of 624,000 actions of the East India
company, which (reckoned at 5000 livres apiece, the price at which
the company had last sold them) amount to 3,120,000,000 livres, or
above 140 millions sterling. Thus at one blow, and in one day, 260
millions sterling of paper currency, payable to bearers, was struck
out of the circulation of France; by an useless and inadvertent act
of power, which ruined the nation, and withered the hand which
struck it: an event too little understood, and too little remembered
in that kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>This plainly appears from their late conduct; for in the end of
1759, at a time when the credit of France was in so flourishing a
situation as to have enabled her to borrow, that very year, near 200
millions of livres; and when there was a prospect of being able
to borrow, in the year following, a far greater sum, the shutting
up what they called their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>caisse d’amortissement</i></span>, for the sake of withholding
32 millions of livres interest due to the creditors, struck all
credit <em>with foreigners</em> dead in one instant.</p>

<p class='c001'>These examples shew what fatal consequences follow a misjudged
exercise of power in matters of credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, the rapid progress of credit in France before
the Missisippi, and the stability of it from 1726 to the year 1759,
abundantly proves, that nothing is more compatible than monarchy
and confidence. All that is wanting is the establishment of <em>one
maxim in government</em>; to wit, that the King’s power is never to extend so
far, as to alter the smallest article of such stipulations as have been
made with those who have lent money for the service of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Maxims in government bind the monarch and the legislature, as laws bind
subjects and subordinate magistrates</em>: the one and the other ought to be
held inviolable, so far as they regard credit; or confidence will be
precarious.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has supported the credit of Great Britain, but the maxim
constantly adhered to, that the public faith pledged to her creditors
is to be inviolable?</p>

<p class='c001'>Does any one doubt, but the legislature of that nation may
spunge out the public debts, with as much ease as a King of France?
But in the one kingdom, the whole nation must be consulted as to
the propriety of such a step; in the other, it may be done at the
instigation of a single person, ignorant of the consequences: but I
hope to make it appear, before the conclusion of this book, that it
is impossible to form a supposition, when a state can be benefited by
deliberately departing, for one moment, from the faith of her engagements.
A national bankruptcy may (no doubt) happen, and
become irreparable; but that must be when the state is emerging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>from a signal calamity, after having been involved in ruin and confusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Confidence, then, is the soul and essence of credit, and in every
modification of it, we shall constantly find it built on that basis;
but this confidence must have for its object a <em>willingness</em> and a
<em>capacity</em> in the debtor to fulfil his obligations.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.1.2' class='c015'>CHAP. II. <br /> <i>Of the Nature of Obligations to be performed, in Consequence of Credit given.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We have already said, that all obligations contracted with a
view to be performed in future time, consist in doing or
giving something; in consideration of something <em>done</em>, or <em>given</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>When actions only are stipulated in contracts, <em>credit</em> (in a strict
acceptation of the term) is little concerned; because no adequate
security can be given for performing an action: such contracts stand
wholly upon the willingness and capacity of <em>acting</em>, which depend
more upon the <em>person</em> than upon the <em>faculties</em> of the debtor. To supply
that defect, we see penalties usually stipulated in such cases; which
reduce those contracts to an alternative obligation of either <em>doing</em>
or <em>giving</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall therefore throw out the consideration of the first altogether,
as being foreign to our purpose; and adhere to the latter,
which is the true object of credit. Again,</p>

<p class='c001'>In all obligations to give any particular thing, there is constantly
implied an alternative also; to wit, either the thing stipulated, or
the value (<em>id quod interest</em>, according to the lawyers) this must be
relative to money; which is the common price of all things in commerce
among men.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Thus we have brought credit to the object under which we are
to consider it, viz. the obligation to pay money, either for value received,
or for some consideration relative to the parties, which may
be the just ground of a contract.</p>

<p class='c001'>Credit and debts are therefore inseparable, and very properly
come to be examined together in this book.</p>

<p class='c001'>When money is to be paid at a distant period of time, the obligation
may either be, 1. for one precise sum; or 2. for that sum
with interest, during the interval between contracting and fulfilling
the obligation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lending of money without interest, was very common,
before the introduction of trade and industry. Money then was
considered as a barren stock, incapable of producing fruit; and
whenever the quantity of it, in any country, exceeded the uses of
circulation, the remainder was locked up in treasures. In that light,
the exacting of interest for it appeared unreasonable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Things are now changed: no money is ever locked up; and the
regular payment of interest for it, when borrowed, is as essential to
the obtaining of credit, as the confidence of being repaid the capital.
These periodical payments are a constant corroboration of this
confidence; so that it may be said, with truth, that he who can
give good security, to pay to perpetuity, a regular interest for money,
will obtain credit for any sum, although it should appear evident,
that he never can be in a capacity to refund the capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason of this may be gathered from the principles already deduced,
and from the plan of our modern oeconomy.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said in the second book, that the current money of a
country is always in proportion to the trade, industry, consumption,
and alienation, which regularly takes place in it; and when it happens
that the money already in the country is not sufficient for
carrying on these purposes, a part of the solid property, equal to
the deficiency, may be melted down (as we have called it) and
made to circulate in paper. That so soon again as this paper augments
beyond that proportion, a part of what was before in circulation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>must return upon the debtor in the paper, and be realized
anew.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now let us consider what is understood by <em>realized</em>. By this term
is meant, that the regorging paper, or that quantity of currency
which a nation possesses over and above what is necessary for its circulation,
must be turned into some shape whereby it may produce
an income; for it is now a maxim, that no money is to be suffered
to remain useless to the proprietor of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When this <em>regorging</em> paper then comes upon the debtor in it, if he
should pay the value of it in hard specie, how would the condition
of the creditor be improved?</p>

<p class='c001'>We suppose the credit of the paper equal to the credit of the coin
within the country. We also suppose that the paper has so stagnated
in the hands of the bearer, that he can neither lend it, or
purchase with it any species of solid property, within the country,
capable to produce an income: for if any way of disposing it usefully
can be found, this circumstance proves that circulation is not,
at that time, fully stocked; consequently, the money does not regorge.
But let us suppose that it does regorge; then he must
either oblige the debtor in the paper to pay in coin, and lock that
up in his coffers, as was the case of old; or he must send his coin
to other countries, where circulation is not fully stocked, and
where an income may be bought with it. This constantly happens
when circulation is either overstocked, or when the quantity of it
begins to diminish in a country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me next suppose, that in a country reasonably stocked with
money, a sudden demand for it, far beyond the ordinary rate of
circulation, should occur: suppose a war to break out, which absorbs,
in a short time, more money than, perhaps, all the coin in a
nation can realize. The state imposes a tax, which, let me suppose,
may produce a sum equal to the interest of the money required. Is
it not very certain, that such persons who found a difficulty in
placing their regorging capitals, will be better pleased to purchase
a part of this annual interest, than to lend it to any person who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>might pay it back in a short time; by which repayment the lender
would again be thrown into the same inconvenience as before, of
finding a proper out-let for it? This is a way of realizing superfluous
money, more effectual than turning it into gold or silver.</p>

<p class='c001'>When I speak, therefore, of realizing paper money, I understand
either the converting it into gold and silver, which is the money of
the world; or the placing of it in such a way as to produce a perpetual
fund of annual interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were public borrowing, therefore, to work the effect of bringing
the money in circulation below the proportion required for carrying
on alienation, then an obligation to repay the capital would be
necessary, and complaints would be heard against the state for not
paying off their debts; because thereby the progress of industry
would be prevented. But when the operations of credit are allowed
to introduce a method of creating money anew, in proportion to
the demand of industry, then the state has no occasion to pay back
capitals; and the public creditors enjoy far better conditions in
their annual income, than if the capitals were refunded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me illustrate this by an example.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must take it for granted, that in every nation in Europe, there
is a sum in circulation equal to the alienation which goes on
actually at the time. We must also take it for granted, that the
amount of all debts whatsoever, public and private, paying interest
to the class of creditors, is a very great sum: now let us suppose,
that the class of debtors should be enabled (no matter by what
means) to pay off what they owe, in coin; would not, by the supposition,
a sum nearly equal to that coin immediately fall into stagnation,
and would it not be impossible to draw any income from it?
This was exactly the case of old. The coin far exceeded the uses
of circulation, and stagnated in treasures. Wars brought it out;
because then circulation augmented; peace again cutting off these
extraordinary demands, the coin stagnated again, and returned to
the treasures.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is the case at present?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Money and coin are never found to surpass the uses of circulation
in commercial countries. When war comes, which demands an
extraordinary supply, recourse is had to borrowing upon interest;
not to treasures: and the desire of purchasing this interest, which
we call an annuity, draws treasures even from the enemies of those
nations who have the best credit. Again, at the end of a war, in
place of an empty treasure, as was the case of old, we find a huge
sum of public debts. As oeconomy filled the treasury then, so oeconomy
must pay off the debts now.</p>

<p class='c001'>From what has been said, it plainly appears, that interest is now
become so absolutely essential to credit, that it may be considered
as the principal requisite, and basis on which the whole fabric
stands: we shall therefore begin by examining the origin and nature
of interest, and also the principles which influence the rate,
and regulate the fluctuations of it.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.1.3' class='c015'>CHAP. III. <br /> <i>Of the Interest of Money.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>I shall leave it to divines and casuists to determine how far
the exacting of interest for money is lawful, according to the
principles of our religion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Jews, by the laws of Moses, were forbid to lend at interest to
their brethren, but it was permitted to lend to strangers. <cite>Deut.</cite> chap.
xxiii. ver. 19, 20. This was one of the wisest political institutions
to be met with in so remote antiquity, as we shall hereafter explain.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the primitive ages of christianity, the lending at interest was
certainly reputed to be unlawful on most occasions. That spirit of
charity, <em>to all who were in want</em>, was so warped in with the doctrine
of our religion, that a borrower was constantly considered to be in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>that situation. Trade was little known; trading men were generally
ill looked upon; and those who deviated so far from the spirit
of the times, as to think of accumulating wealth by the use of their
money, commonly degenerated into usurers.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the middle centuries, when a mistaken zeal animated christianity
with a most ungodly thirst for the blood of infidels, the Jews
were, in every nation in Europe, almost the only money lenders.
This circumstance still more engaged the church to dart her thunder
against this practice; and the loan upon interest never took root
among christians, until a spirit of trade and industry sprung up in
Italy in the time of the Lombards, and spread itself through the
channel of the Hans-towns over several nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the church began to open her eyes, and saw the expediency
of introducing many modifications, to limit the general anathema
against the whole class of money lenders. At one time it was declared
lawful to lend at interest, when the capital shared any risque
in the hands of the borrower; at another, it was found allowable;
when the capital was not demandable from the debtor, while he
paid the interest: again, it was permitted, when the debtor was
declared by sentence of a judge, to be <em>in mora</em> in acquitting his
obligation: at last, it was permitted on bills of exchange. In short,
in most Roman catholic countries, interest is now permitted in
every case almost, except in obligations bearing a stipulation of interest
for sums demandable at any time after the term of payment;
and it is as yet no where considered as essential to loan, or demandable
upon obligations payable on demand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Expediency and the good of society (politically speaking) are the
only rule for judging, when the loan upon interest should be permitted,
when forbid. While people borrowed only in order to procure
a circulating equivalent for providing their necessaries, until
they could have time to dispose of their effects; and while there was
seldom any certain profit to be made by the use of the money borrowed,
by turning it into trade, it was very natural to consider the
lender in an unfavourable light; because it was supposed that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>money, if not lent, must have remained locked up in his coffers.
But at present, when we see so many people employed in providing
stores of necessaries for others, which, without money, could not
be done; forbidding the loan upon interest, has the effect of locking
up the very instrument (money) which is necessary for supplying
the wants of the society. The loan, therefore, upon interest, <em>as
society now stands composed</em>, is established, not in favour of the lenders,
but of the whole community; and taking the matter in this light,
no one, I suppose, will pretend that what is beneficial to a whole
society should be forbid, because of its being proportionably advantageous
to some particular members of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be then allowed, that the loan upon interest is a good political
institution, relative to the present situation of European societies,
the next question is, to determine a proper standard for it, so
as to avoid the oppression of usurers, on one hand, and on the other,
to allow such a reasonable profit to the lender, as may engage him
to throw his money into circulation for the common advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>This question leads us directly to the examination of the principles
which regulate the rate of interest; and if we can discover
a certain rule, arising from the nature of things, and from the
principles of commerce, which may direct a statesman how to
establish a proper regulation in that matter, we may decide with
certainty concerning the exact limits, between unlawful and pinching
usury, exacted by a vicious set of men, who profit of the distress
of individuals; and that reasonable equivalent which men
have a right to expect for the use of their money, lent for carrying
on the circulation of trade, and the employment of the lower classes
of a people, who must subsist by their industry or labour.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h4 id='ch4.1.4' class='c015'>CHAP. IV. <br /> <i>Of the</i> Principles <i>which regulate the Rate of Interest</i>.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We must now recal to mind the principles of demand and competition,
so fully deduced in the second book, in order to
answer the following question, viz.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is the principle which regulates, at all times, the just and
adequate rate of interest for money, in any particular state?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, That at all times, there is in every state a certain number
of persons who have occasion to borrow money, and a certain
number of persons who desire to lend: there is also a certain sum
of money demanded by the borrowers, and a certain sum offered
to be lent. The borrowers desire to fix the interest as <em>low</em> as they
can; the lenders seek, from a like principle of self-interest, to carry
the rate of it as high as <em>they</em> can.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this combination of interests arises a double competition,
which fluctuates between the two parties. If more is demanded to
be borrowed, than there is found to be lent, the competition will
take place among the borrowers. Such among them who have the
most pressing occasion for money, will offer the highest interest,
and will be preferred. If, on the contrary, the money to be lent
exceeds the demand of the borrowers, the competition will be upon
the other side. Such of the lenders, who have the most pressing
occasion to draw an interest for their money, will offer it at the
lowest interest, and this offer will be accepted of.</p>

<p class='c001'>I need not launch out into a repetition of what has been said concerning
the influence of double competition, in fixing the price of
commodities: I suppose those principles understood, and well
retained, by those who read this chapter; and confine myself here
to what is peculiar to the demand for money.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The price of commodities is extremely fluctuating: they are all
calculated for particular uses; money serves every purpose. Commodities,
though of the same kind, differ in goodness: money <em>is</em>
all, or <em>ought to be</em> all of the same value, relative to its denominations.
Hence the <em>price of money</em> (which is what we express by the term
<em>interest</em>) is susceptible of a far greater stability and uniformity, than
the price of any other thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have shewn in the 28th chapter of the second book, in examining
the principles which regulate the prices of subsistence, that
the only thing which can fix a standard there, is frequent and
familiar alienation. The same holds true of money. Were we to
suppose a state, where borrowing and lending are not common,
and where the laws fix no determinate interest for money, it would
hardly be possible to ascertain the rate of it at any time. This was
the case of old.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the reign of Henry VIII. of England, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1545, there was
no statute regulating the rate of interest in that kingdom. The reason
is very plain. In those days there was little circulation, and
the borrowing upon interest was considered as a mortal sin. The
consequence of this was, that usurers, having nothing but conscience
to restrain them, carried the price of their money to a level
with the pressing occasion of spendthrifts, while others, from friendship,
lent for no interest at all. Henry fixed the rate of interest at
10 <i>per cent.</i> and his cotemporary, Francis I. of France, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1522,
(who was the first who borrowed money in a regular manner upon
the town-house of Paris) fixed the interest at the 12th penny, that
is, at 8⅓ <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>In those days, it was impossible for a statesman to determine any
just rate for interest; and accordingly we find history filled with the
extortion of usurers, on one hand, and the violence and injustice
of Princes and ministers towards those who had lent them money,
on the other: was it then any wonder, that lending at interest was
universally cried out against? It really produced very little good,
and was the cause of manifold calamities to a state. When the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Prince borrowed, it was when in the most urgent distress: those
who lent to him, foresaw the danger of being plundered if they
refused, and of being defrauded as soon as the public distress was
over: for this reason they exacted the most exorbitant interest: the
consequence was, that the people were loaded with the most grievous
taxes, and the tax-gatherers were the Prince’s creditors, to whom
such taxes were assigned.</p>

<p class='c001'>In our days, trade, industry, and a call for money for such purposes,
enable the borrower to enrich himself, to supply the wants
of the state, and to pay his interest regularly.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we compare the two situations, we shall find every disadvantage
attending the former, and every advantage connected with the
latter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without good faith there is no credit; without credit there is no
borrowing of money, no trade, no industry, no circulation, no
bread for the lower classes, no luxury, not even the conveniencies
of life, for the rich. Under these circumstances, there can be no
rule for the rate of interest; because borrowing cannot be frequent
and familiar.</p>

<p class='c001'>In proportion, therefore, as borrowing becomes frequent and
familiar, the rule for fixing the rate of a legal interest becomes
more practicable to a statesman. Let me take a step farther.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said, that it is the fluctuation of the double competition
between borrowers and lenders, which occasions the rise and fall of
the rate of interest; I must now point out the principles which occasion
this fluctuation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were the interests of trade and industry so exactly established, as
to produce the same profit on every branch, the money borrowed
for carrying them on, would naturally be taken at the same rate;
but this is not the case: some branches afford more, some less profit.
In proportion, therefore, to the advantages to be reaped from borrowed
money, the borrowers offer more or less for the use of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the class of men who borrow <em>in order to profit</em> by the loan,
there is another class, who borrow <em>in order to dissipate</em>. The first class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>never can offer an interest which exceeds the proportion of their
gains: the second class, finding nothing but want of credit to limit
their expence, become a prey to usurers. Were it not then upon
account of these last, there would be no occasion for a statute to
regulate the rate of interest. The profits on trade would strike an
average among the industrious classes; and that average would fall
and rise, in proportion to the flourishing or decay of commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine the principles which prevent the monied
men from committing extortions, and which oblige them to lend
their money for that rate of interest which is in proportion to the
profits upon trade and industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>In every country there is found a sum of money (that is, of circulating
value, no matter whether coin or paper) proportioned to
the trade and industry of it. How this sum is determined, and how
it is made to augment and diminish in proportion to industry, we
have already explained in the 26th chapter of <a id='corr118.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='this'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_118.16'><ins class='correction' title='this'>the</ins></a></span> second book: we
are now to examine some of the consequences which result from
the accidental stagnation of any part of it to the prejudice of alienation;
and we must shew how the loan upon interest is the means of
throwing it again into circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are in every state some who spend more, and some who
spend less than their income. What is not spent must stagnate; or
be lent to those who spend more than the produce of their own
funds. Were the first class found so to preponderate, as to require
more money to borrow than all that is to be lent, the consequence
would be, to prevent the borrowing of merchants; to raise interest
so high as to extinguish trade; and to destroy industry; and these
resources coming to fail, foreign commodities would be brought
in, while exportation would be stopt, money would disappear, and
all would fall into decay.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, I believe, is a case which seldom happens; because the rise
of interest (as states are now formed) has so much the effect of depreciating
the value of every species of solid property, that spendthrifts
are quickly stripped of them, by the growing accumulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>of that canker worm, interest; their ruin terrifies many from following
so hurtful an example, and their property falling into the
hands of the other class, who spend less than their income; these
new possessors introduce, by their example, a more frugal set of
manners. This may be the case in countries where trade and industry
have been introduced; and where the operations of credit
have been able to draw a large quantity of solid property into circulation,
according to the principles deduced in the chapter above
referred to. But in nations of idleness, who circulate their coin
only, and who are deprived of the resource of credit, high interest
prevents them from emerging out of their sloth; the little trade
they have, continues to produce great profits, which are incompatible
with foreign commerce: this may, indeed, make the coin
they have circulate for home consumption, but can bring nothing
from abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, when trade and industry flourish, and a
monied interest is formed, in consequence of melting down of solid
property, and still more when a state <a id='corr119.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='seems'>comes</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_119.18'><ins class='correction' title='seems'>comes</ins></a></span> to contract great debts,
were the money lenders to attempt to raise the rate of interest to the
standard of the spendthrift, the demands of trade, &amp;c. would soon
be cut off: the stagnation would then swell so fast in their hands,
that it would in a manner choak them, and in a little time interest
would fall to nothing. Whereas by contenting themselves with the
standard of trade, the largest supplies (provided for the borrowers)
easily find a vent, without raising the rate of interest so high as to
be hurtful to any interest within the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Add to this, that the advantage of realizing, into lands, so unstable
a property as money, must naturally throw the proprietors
of it into a competition for the lands which dissipation brings to
market; and so by raising the value of these, they, with their own
hands, defeat the consequences of the dissipation of spendthrifts,
and hurt their own interest, to wit, the rise of the price of money.
From a combination of these circumstances, lenders become obliged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>to part with their money at that rate of interest which is the most
consistent with the good of commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have hitherto preserved our combinations as simple as possible.
We have suggested no extrinsic obstacle to borrowing and
lending. If money is to be lent, and if people are found who incline
to borrow, we have taken it for granted, that circulation will
go on; and that the stagnations in the hands of the lenders, will
find a ready vent by the dissipation of the other class: we must now
take a step farther.</p>

<p class='c001'>The spendthrifts must have credit; that is, they must have it in
their power to repay with interest what they have borrowed: any
impediment to credit, has the effect either of diminishing the demand
for money, and consequently of lowering the rate of interest,
or of introducing unlawful usury. If we suppose the rate of interest
well determined, and usury prevented by a regular execution
of good laws, it is very certain, that a statesman by hurting the
credit of extravagant people, will keep the rate of interest within
due bounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, we find the laws of any country, in our days, defective
in establishing a facility in securing money on solid property,
while the rate of interest stands higher than is consistent with the
good of trade, and with public credit; we should be slow in finding
fault with such a defect. The motives of statesmen lie very deep;
and they are not always at liberty to explain them. An example of
such clogs upon credit are entails upon lands, and the want of proper
registers for mortgages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did the dissipation of landed men tend to promote foreign trade,
such clogs would be pernicious: but if the tendency be to promote
domestic luxury only, and thereby raise the price of labour and industry,
the case is widely different. This observation is only by the
bye. Our object at present extends no farther, than to point out,
that the dissipation of landed men, and the credit they have to borrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>money, influences, not a little, the rate of interest in every modern
state.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are the general principles which, arising from things themselves,
without the interposition of a statesman, tend to regulate the
rate of interest in commercial nations.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.1.5' class='c015'>CHAP. V. <br /> <i>Of the Regulation of Interest by Statute.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>From the principles deduced in the preceeding chapter, we
have seen how, without the aid of any law, the interest of
money, in a trading nation, becomes determined, from natural
causes, and from the irresistible effects of competition.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as there is no country in the world so entirely given to commerce,
as not to contain great numbers of people, who are totally
unacquainted with it, a regulation becomes necessary to restrain,
on one hand, the frenzy of those, who, listening to nothing but the
violence of their passions, are willing to procure money at any rate
for the gratification of them, let the political consequences of their
dissipation prove ever so hurtful; and on the other, to protect those
who, from necessity, may be obliged to submit to the heavy oppression
of their usurious creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Laws restraining usury, are directly calculated for the sake of
those two classes, not engaged in commerce, and indirectly calculated
for commerce itself; which otherwise might receive a wound
through their sides.</p>

<p class='c001'>In entring upon the subject mentioned in the title of this chapter,
I think we may agree in this, that hitherto all regulations made
concerning interest, have been calculated either for bringing it
down, or for preventing its rise. The distress which may come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>upon a state, by its falling too low, is a phænomenon which has
not yet manifested itself in any modern state, by any symptom I
can at present recollect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now if it be true, as I think it has been proved, that the operations
of demand and competition work irresistible effects in determining
the rate of interest in commercial states; the statesman
who is about to make a regulation, must keep these principles constantly
in his eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we examine the writings of those who have treated of this subject
with intelligence (among whom, I think, Child has a right to
stand in the foremost rank) we shall find very little attention bestowed
upon that most necessary and ruling principle.</p>

<p class='c001'>He lays it down as an axiom, that low interest is the soul of trade,
in which he is certainly right; but he seems to think, <em>that it is in
the power of a legislature, by statute, to bring interest down to that level
which is most advantageous to trade</em>; and in this I differ from him. I
must do him the justice to say, that he no where directly affirms
that proposition; but by suggesting none of the inconveniences
which may follow upon an arbitrary reduction of interest by statute,
he leaves his reader at liberty to suppose, that the lowering of it is
solely in the hands of a statesman.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is very plain, from the history he has given us of the successive
rates of interest in England, from 10 to 6 <i>per cent.</i> that without the
interposition of statutes, such diminutions would not, <em>in that period</em>,
have taken place, from the principle of competition: but I am not
so clear that, <em>at this time</em>, when trade is so well understood, and credit
so generally established in many nations of Europe, that a like
administration would work effects equally advantageous.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is with great diffidence I presume to differ from Child upon
this subject; and I find a sensible satisfaction in perceiving that my
principles bring me so very near to his sentiments on this matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The strong arguments in favour of Child’s opinion, are grounded
upon facts. He says, that when interest was brought down by
statute, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1625, from 10 to 8 <i>per cent.</i> that in place of producing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>any bad effect, it had that of bringing it still lower immediately
afterwards; and the same thing happened, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1650, when it was
reduced a second time by statute, from 8 to 6 <i>per cent.</i> at which rate
it stood at the time he wrote. These facts I give credit to, and shall
now account for them, from the consequences of sudden revolutions.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a law is made for the reduction of interest, all debtors immediately
profit by it. Upon this, the creditors must either submit,
or call in their capitals. If they submit, land immediately rises in
its value. If they call in their capitals, they must have an outlet
for lending them out again, beyond the limits of the jurisdiction
of the legislature. Now this outlet was not then to be found; because
credit was no where well established, except in Holland, where
interest was still lower.</p>

<p class='c001'>They were, therefore, obliged to submit, and thus interest was
violently brought down by statute; and a great advantage resulted
from it to the commercial interests of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The subsequent fall of interest, in the natural way, is thus easily
accounted for.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence of lowering the interest, was, that the price of
land rose several years in purchase: the landed men, who had long
groaned under the heavy interest of 10 <i>per cent.</i> finding their lands
rise from 12 years purchase to 15, upon reducing the interest to 8
<i>per cent.</i> sold off part of their lands, and cleared themselves. The
natural consequence of this was, to make money regorge in the
hands of the monied men; to diminish the number of borrowers;
and consequently, to bring the rate of interest still lower.</p>

<p class='c001'>One sudden revolution produces another. When interest is
brought down by statute, the price of land must rise by a jerk; and
landed men will suddenly profit of the change in their favour.
When it falls gently, by natural revolutions in the state of demand,
the effects are more insensible; the sharper sighted only profit of it;
others, from expectation of a still greater rise in the price of their
lands, neglect to sell in the proper point of time; and may perhaps
be disappointed from a new fluctuation in favour of money. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>is at present actually the case in Great Britain, since the peace of
1762. I write in 1764.</p>

<p class='c001'>These facts speak strongly in favour of Child’s opinion, that it is
expedient to have recourse directly to the statute, whenever there is
a prospect of advancing the interests of trade by a reduction of
interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible to reply to matters of fact: all, therefore, I have
to allege in favour of my own opinion, is, that it is more consistent
with the very principles in which both Child and I agree; it
implies no sudden revolution, and will, in a short time, operate the
same effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method of proceeding, according to my principles, is shortly
this.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since it is agreed on all hands, that low interest is the soul of
trade, and the firmest basis of public credit; that it rises in proportion
to the demand of borrowers, and sinks in proportion as money
is made to regorge in the hands of the monied interest;</p>

<p class='c001'>The statesman should set out by such steps of administration as
will discourage borrowing, in those who employ their money in
prodigality and dissipation, as far as may be consistent with the
interest of the lower classes employed in supplying home consumption,
according to the principles laid down in the second book.
He should abstain from borrowing himself, and even from creating
new outlets for money, except from the most cogent motives. By
this he will, in a short time, gently reduce the rate of interest.
Then by statute he may bring it down a little, but not so very low
as the foregoing operations may have reduced it; contenting himself
with having farther restricted the extent of the ordinary fluctuations.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for example: let us suppose interest limited by law to 5 <i>per
cent.</i> and that by good management the state may be enabled to borrow
easily at 3 <i>per cent.</i> I believe there would result a notable advantage,
in reducing the legal rate to 4 <i>per cent.</i> and were it brought
down to 3 <i>per cent.</i> there might follow a very great inconvenience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>to landed men, in case a war should suddenly occasion a revolution
in favour of money.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference then between Child and me, is, that I am more
scrupulous than he, in introducing restraint into political oeconomy;
and my only reason against applying the statute, as he proposes, is
for fear of the immediate bad effects which might follow (in many
ways impossible to be foreseen) upon a sudden and violent revolution,
in a point so excessively delicate as public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his days, credit was not so well established, nor was it stretched
as at present: it was more accustomed to violent shocks, and could
bear a rougher treatment. But in order to come the better to a
thorough knowledge of this matter, let us examine into what might
be the consequence, if Great Britain should, at this time, bring
down, by statute, the rate of interest <em>below the level of the stocks</em>, which
I take to be the best rule of determining the present value of money;
and this is also the best method of examining the expediency
of Child’s method of reducing interest, under the present combination
of all our political circumstances.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.1.6' class='c015'>CHAP. VI. <br /> <i>What would be the Consequence of reducing, by a British Statute, the legal Interest of Money below the present level of the Stocks.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>When Great Britain borrows money upon the public faith,
the rate of interest is always stipulated, and these stipulations
must be religiously fulfilled, or credit will be at an end.</p>

<p class='c001'>The regulations then proposed to be made, must only refer to
contracts of loan entred into by private parties.</p>

<p class='c001'>The current value of money, I think, is best to be determined by
the price of stocks. If a 4 <i>per cent.</i> sells at par, money may be said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>to be then at 4 <i>per cent.</i> If the same stock falls to 89, then the value
of money rises to near 4½: if the same stock rises to 114, then the
value of money falls to about 3½; and so in proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>According, therefore, as stock is found to rise, the price of money
falls, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose, then, the price of money to be at 4 <i>per cent.</i> and that
government should pass a law, forbidding any man to lend at above
3 <i>per cent.</i> what would be the consequence? This is exactly the
expedient proposed by Child: money then was at 6 <i>per cent.</i> and he
proposes, <em>by a law</em>, to bring it, all at once, to 4, without alledging
that money was then commonly got by private convention at so low
a rate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Would not the consequence be, that the creditors of private people
would demand their money, in order to get 4 <i>per cent.</i> in buying
stock, and would not this additional demand for stocks make them
rise? I answer in the affirmative, unless money could be employed
abroad, so as to produce at least 4 <i>per cent.</i> to the lenders, free of all
charge of commission, &amp;c. If it could not, I have little doubt, but
that money would soon fall to the legal interest of 3 <i>per cent.</i> land
would rise to 40 years purchase; and landed men would profit of
the rise, as Child says was the case in his time. The whole inconvenience
would be limited to the immediate effects of the sudden
revolution; which would occasion so great a run upon the landed
interest, as to reduce them to an utter incapacity of answering it.
This might be, in some measure, prevented, by a clause in the act,
allowing a certain time for the liquidation of their debts. But who
will pretend to foretell the immediate consequences of so great a
stagnation of credit, and borrowing on land security? The purses
of all monied people, would, for some time at least, be fast shut
against their demand. What a shock again, would this be to all
inland trade, what a discouragement to all the manufacturing interest,
what distress upon all creditors for accounts furnished, and
upon those who supply daily wants! I think, even supposing that
in a year or two, the first effects might come to disappear, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>notable advantage result, in the main, to the commercial interest of
Great Britain, yet the distress in the interval might prove so hurtful,
as to render it quite intolerable. The common people who live by
the luxury of the rich, in the city of London, and who are constantly
acted upon by the immediate feelings of present inconveniences,
might lose all patience; and being blown into a ferment, by the
address of the monied interest (whose condition would be made to
suffer by the scheme) might throw the state into confusion, and
impress the nation with a belief, that high interest for money, in
place of being hurtful, was essential to their prosperity.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said above, that supposing the money drawn from debtors,
could not be placed abroad, free of all deductions, at a rate equal
to the then value of money (supposed, for the sake of an example,
to be at 4 <i>per cent.</i>) that then money would fall to 3 <i>per cent.</i> and the
stocks would rise in proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>But let us suppose (what perhaps is the matter of fact) that the
extensive operations of trade and credit, do actually fix an average
for the price of stocks, from the value of money in other nations in
Europe. Would not then the consequence of bringing down the
rate of legal interest, below that level, be, to send out of the kingdom
all the money now circulating on private security, real and
personal? Would not this destroy all private credit at one blow?
Would it not have the effect of preventing, among individuals, the
loan upon interest altogether? What would become of the bank of
England, and all other banks, whose paper in circulation is all in
the hands of private people? Is not every man who has a bank note,
a creditor on the bank, and would not the same interest which
moves other creditors to exact their debts, under such circumstances,
also move many holders of bank notes, to demand payment of
them? Would not a run of that nature, only for a few weeks,
throw the whole nation into the most dreadful distress? May we not
even suppose, that upon such an occasion, the monied interest (<em>from
a certainty of disappointing the intention of government in making the law</em>)
might form a combination among themselves to lock up their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>money, even although it should remain dead in their hands for a
few months? What would become of the improvement of land?
Is there an industrious farmer any where to be met with, who does
not borrow money, which he can so profitably turn to account upon
his farm, even though he receives it at the highest legal interest?
These and many more inconveniences <em>might</em> manifest themselves,
were government to force down the value of money, contrary to
the ordinary operations of demand and competition: and to what
purpose have recourse to authority, when it is most certain, that
without any such expedient the same end may be compassed?</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be true, as I believe it is, that in states where credit is so well
established, that their funds or public debts are commonly negotiated
abroad, there is an average fixed for the value of money, by
the operations of credit over the commercial world: and if it be
true, that no law can be framed so as to restrain mercantile people,
and those who make a trade of money, from turning it to the best
account; then all that should be proposed by government, is, to preserve
the value of it at home, within that standard. For which purpose,
nothing more is necessary than to prevent the competition of
the dissipating class of inhabitants, from disturbing the rate which
commerce may establish from time to time. This is accomplished
by the methods above hinted at, and which in the next chapter
shall be more largely insisted on. If, by prudent management, the
<em>conventional</em> rate of interest, can thus be brought below the <em>legal</em>,
then there will be no harm in diminishing the latter by statute, not
however <em>quite</em> so low as the conventional standard; but to leave a
reasonable latitude for gentle fluctuations above it. From what I
have said, I still think I had reason to object to Child’s plan for forcing
down the interest by statute: and had he lived at this time, I
am persuaded he would have come into that opinion.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.1.7' class='c015'>CHAP. VII. <br /> <i>Methods of bringing down the Rate of Interest, in Consequence of the Principles of Demand and Competition.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I hope the arguments used in the foregoing chapter will not be
construed as an apology for the high interest of money.</p>

<p class='c001'>I entirely agree with Sir Josiah Child, that low interest is the soul
of trade; the most active principle for promoting industry, and
the improvement of land; and a requisite, without which it is
hardly possible that foreign commerce can long be supported.</p>

<p class='c001'>This proposition I take to be at this time universally admitted to
be true; and did there remain, concerning it, the vestige of a
doubt in the mind of any one, the writings of many, much more
capable than I can pretend to be, and among the rest the author just
now cited, are sufficiently capable to remove it. I shall not therefore
trouble my reader with a chapter upon that head, but only observe,
that the terms <em>high</em> and <em>low</em> are constantly relative. Here the
relation must be understood to regard other states, because when
we speak of a <em>rate</em> of interest, we are supposed to mean something
general in the country we are speaking of: accordingly, if we
could suppose that, within the same state, the rate of interest should
be lower in one city than any where else, that circumstance would
give an advantage to that city in all its mercantile operations.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must farther observe, for the sake of connecting this part of
our subject with our general plan, that the low interest for money
is most essential to such states as carry on the most extensive foreign
commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the infancy of industry, and before trade comes to be established,
it is very natural that the coin of the country should be
found in a great measure locked up in treasures: high interest
tends to bring it forth, and in that respect works a good effect.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>In proportion as alienation augments, money comes to be multiplied,
by the melting down of solid property, as has been explained;
and then the business of a statesman is to contrive expedients
for bringing the rate of it as low as possible, in order to
support foreign trade, and to rival all neighbouring nations, where
interest is higher. When foreign trade again comes to decline,
from the multiplication of abuses introduced by luxury, low interest
still continues useful, for supporting public credit, so necessary
for defending a nation against her enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>If money consisted only in the precious metals, which are not to
be found in every country, but must be purchased with the produce
of industry, and brought from far; and if no other expedient
could be fallen upon to supply their place for the uses of circulation;
then the possessors of these metals would in a manner be
masters to establish what rate of interest they thought fit for the
use of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if that be not the case, and if money can be made of paper,
to the value of all the solid property of a nation, (so far as occasion
is found for it, by the owners of that property) the use of the
metals comes to be in a manner reduced to that of serving as a
standard, for ascertaining the value of the denominations of money
of accompt; perhaps for facilitating the circulation of small
sums, and for paying a balance of trade to other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>When this is the case, a statesman has it in his power to increase
or diminish the extent of credit and paper money in circulation, by
various expedients, which greatly influence the rate of interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The progress of credit has been very rapid since the beginning
of this century. This has been almost entirely owing to the mechanical
combinations of trading men. Lawgivers have hitherto
had but imperfect notions concerning the nature of it; and there
still remains, in the womb of nature, some mighty genius, born
to govern a commercial nation, who alone will be able to set it on
its true principles. Let us in the mean time speculate concerning
them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>We have said, and every body feels, that interest falls in proportion
to the redundancy of money to be lent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now what is this money but property, of one kind or other,
thrown into circulation? I speak of trading nations, who are not
confined to the quantity of their specie alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a man of property wants money, does he not go to a
bank, which lends upon mortgage, and by pledging his security,
does he not receive money, which is in the same instant created for
his use? Do not those notes circulate as long as they are found necessary
for carrying on the affairs of the nation? that is to say,
the accompts of debtors and creditors of all denominations; and
as soon as the quantity of them exceeds that proportion, they stagnate,
and return on the debtors in them, (the bank) who is enabled
to realize them, because the original security is still in their
hands, which was at first pledged when the notes were issued. This
realization is commonly made in the metals; because they are the
money of the world: they are real and true riches, as much as
land; and they have this advantage over land, that they are transportable
every where.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, does it not appear evident, that what we have been describing
is a round-about operation, which it is possible to shorten?</p>

<p class='c001'>I beg of my reader, that he may attend to one thing; which is,
that I am not here treating of, or proposing a plan, but labouring
in the deduction of principles in an intricate subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>I say, when landed men go to such a bank, and receive paper
for a land security, that this operation may be shortened.</p>

<p class='c001'>Do not the notes he gets stand (though that is not expressed)
upon the security of his land? Now, can any man assign any other
reason but custom, why his own notes, carrying expresly in their
bosom the same security, might not be issued, without his being
obliged to interpose the bank between the public and himself: And
for what does he pay that interest? Not that he has gratuitously
received any value from the bank; because in his obligation he has
given a full equivalent for the notes; but the obligation carries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>interest, and the notes carry none. Why? Because the one circulates
like money, the other does not. For this advantage, therefore,
of circulation, not for any additional value, does the landed
man pay interest to the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had landed men, and not merchants, invented this method of
turning their property into circulation, and had they been all assembled
in one body, with a legislative authority, I imagine they
would have had wit enough to find out that a land bank was a
thing practicable in its nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose they had agreed that all their lands should be let by the
acre, and that land property should be esteemed at a certain number
of years purchase, in proportion to the rate of interest at the
time, where would be the great difficulty in paying in lands?</p>

<p class='c001'>This is only a hint, to which a thousand objections may be made,
as matters stand: all I say, is, that there is nothing here against
principles; and though there might, in every way such a plan
could be laid down, result inconveniencies to the landed interest,
yet still these inconveniencies would hardly counterbalance that of
their being obliged to pay interest for every penny they borrow.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is demanded, what advantage would result to the nation from
such a regulation?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that by it all the borrowings of landed men would be
struck out of the competition at the money-market. The money’d
interest alone would borrow among themselves for the purposes of
trade, (for money’d men do not borrow to squander) and landed
men would consequently pay with their own paper, in every case,
where now they borrow in order to pay. Thus interest would be
regulated by the demands of trade, and the rate of it would not
be disturbed by the competition of spendthrifts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Who can say how far the consequences of such a scheme might
reach? Might not landed men begin in time to issue notes by way
of loan, at a very <a id='corr132.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='considerable'>inconsiderable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_132.32'><ins class='correction' title='considerable'>inconsiderable</ins></a></span> interest? But I do not incline to
carry my speculations farther: perhaps what has been said may
appear sufficiently aerial.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>If a statesman shall find every modification of this idea impracticable;
either from his own want of power, or of combination, or,
which is more probable, from the opposition of the money’d interest,
he must take other measures for striking out, as much as
possible, the competition of spendthrifts at the money-market.
Entails, and lame securities, are good expedients; though they are
productive of many inconveniencies. His own frugal &oelig;conomy
in state affairs will go much farther than any such trifling expedients.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did a nation enjoying peace, although indebted perhaps 140
millions sterling, begin by paying off but 2 <i>per cent.</i> of their capital
yearly, besides the current interest; while no neighbouring state
was borrowing any; what would interest fall to in a short time!
It may be answered, that the consequence would be, to enrich other
nations; because the regorging money would be sent abroad. Is
any state ever enriched by their borrowing? And in what does such
lending to foreigners differ from the nation’s paying off their foreign
creditors? Will not the return of interest from abroad compensate,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro tanto</i></span>, the sums sent out for the like purpose?</p>

<p class='c001'>But if it be said, that the consequence will be to enable other
nations to bring down their own rate of interest; I allow it to be
so; and so much the better, as long as it remains proportionally
lower with us; which it must do, as long as we can lend abroad.
We have said, and I believe with truth, that as credit is now extended,
a general average is struck every where upon the value of
money: consequently, the lower interest is found abroad, the lower
still it will remain at home, as long as merchants and exchangers
subsist.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this circumstance of the average on the rate of interest,
the Dutch must, I think, have lost the great advantage they formerly
enjoyed, from the low rate of it in Holland, in proportion
to their neighbours.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Child’s time, they were familiarly buying up sugars in London,
above the price paid by English sugar-bakers; and, notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the additional freight and charges, they grew rich by
their trade, while the others were hardly making any profit. This
he accounts for, from the low rate of their interest. He supposes
both Dutch and English to have carried on this trade with borrowed
money; for which the first paid 3 <i>per cent.</i> and the other 6 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>But at present, were it possible to get 6 <i>per cent.</i> for money in
London, what Dutchman would lend his father a shilling at 3 <i>per
cent.</i>? The English stocks are as currently bought and sold, nay,
all the stockjobbing tricks are practised with the same subtlety at
Amsterdam as in Change-Alley: from which I conclude, that a
great part of the advantage of low interest is now lost to that nation;
and I conclude farther, that it is the common interest of all
trading nations to bring it as low as possible every where.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another cause of high interest proceeds from certain clogs laid
upon circulation, which proceed merely from custom and prejudice.
Of this nature is the obligation of debtors to pay in the metals,
nothing but coin being a legal tender.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only foundation for such a regulation was the precariousness
of credit in former times. Were all the circulating paper in a nation
secured by law, either upon the lands or revenue of the
country appropriated for that purpose, there could be no injustice
or inconvenience in making paper (so secured) a legal tender in
all payments. Again, how extraordinary must it appear to any
reasonable man, that the same paper which passes on one side of a
river, should not pass on its opposite bank, though running
through the same country?</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason indeed is very plain: the subaltern jurisdictions are
different; and the debtors in the paper are different: but if the paper
of both stood upon a security equally good, what is to hinder both
to be received as a legal tender in all payments over the kingdom?
Should not little private objects of profit among bankers (who are
the servants of the state, and who are so well paid for their service)
be over-ruled, when the consequences of their disputes are found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>to be so hurtful? But of this more, when we come to speak of
banks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only occasion where coin is necessary in the liquidation of
paper, is for payment of the balance of trade with foreign nations.
Of this also we shall treat more at large, when we come
to the doctrine of exchange. But surely nothing is so ill judged,
as to create an imaginary balance within the same state; or rather,
to permit money-jobbers to create it; at the expence of raising
interest, and hurting trade, in the very places where it stands in
the greatest need of encouragement.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these principles, and others which naturally flow from
them, may a statesman steer a very certain course, towards bringing
the rate of interest as low as the prosperity of trade requires,
or the principles of double competition between borrowers and
lenders will permit.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.1.8' class='c015'>CHAP. VIII. <br /> <i>Is the Rate of Interest the sure Barometer of the State of Commerce?</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Some political writers are fond of every expedient to reduce
within a narrow compass many questions, which being involved
in intricate combinations, cannot be reduced to one principle.
This throws them into what I call systems; of which we
have an example in the question now before us.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is nothing more difficult than to determine when commerce
runs favourably, and when unfavourably for a nation.
This would not be the case, were the rate of interest the just barometer
of it. I have found it however advanced, that nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>more is necessary to be known, in order to estimate the relative
profits upon the foreign trade of two nations, than to compare the
common rate of interest in both, and to decide the preference in
favour of that nation where it is found to be lowest.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may say of this proposition, as of the course of exchange;
the lowness of interest and exchange are both exceedingly favourable
to trade; but they are no adequate measure of the profits
arising from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The best argument in favour of this opinion with regard to interest
is, that the nation which sells the cheapest at foreign markets
is constantly preferred; and, consequently, where the use of
money is the lowest, the merchant can sell the cheapest.</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that this consequence <em>would</em> be just, were all trade carried
on with borrowed money, and were the difference of the price
of the materials or first matter, the ease in procuring them, the
promptitude of payments, the industry of the manufacturer, and
his dexterity, reckoned for nothing. But such advantages are frequently
found in these articles, as to be more than sufficient to
counterbalance the additional interest which is paid for the money
employed in trade. This is so true, that we see the dexterity alone
of the workman (living in an expensive capital, where the charge
of living may be double of what it is in the country) enabling
him to undersell his competitors every where: the same may be
true with regard to the other articles. Farther, how far is it not
from truth to say, that all <em>trade</em> is carried on with borrowed money?
When the term <em>trade</em> here made use of, is properly understood, we
shall see, that a very inconsiderable part of its object is carried on
with borrowed money, in any country in Europe; and that part
which is carried on with borrowed money is not so much clogged
by the high rate of interest, as by want of punctuality in payments.
A merchant who can turn his money in three months, borrows
as cheaply at 6 <i>per cent.</i> as another who turns his in six
months, when he borrows at 3 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The object of trade is produce and manufacture. If any one
will consider the value of these two articles, before they come into
the hands of merchants, and compare this with the money borrowed
by farmers and manufacturers, in order to bring them to
market, the proportion will be very small.</p>

<p class='c001'>Do we not see every day, that ingenious workmen, who obtain
credit for very small sums, are soon enabled, by the means of
their own industry, to produce a surprizing value in manufactures,
and not only to subsist, but to increase in riches? The interest
they pay for the money borrowed is inconsiderable, when
compared with the value, created (as it were) by the proper employment
of their time and talents.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be said, that this is a vague assertion, supported by no
proof; I answer, that the value of a man’s work may be estimated
by the proportion between the manufacture when brought to market,
and the first matter. Nothing but the first matter, and the instruments
of manufacture, can be considered as the objects of borrowed
money; unless we go so far as to estimate the nourishment,
and every expence of the manufacturer, and suppose that these are
also supplied from borrowed money. To affirm that, would be
turning arguments into cavil.</p>

<p class='c001'>The object, therefore, of borrowed money for carrying on
trade, is more relative to the merchant than to the manufacturer.
Borrowing is necessary for collecting all this product and manufacture
into the hands of merchants. This, no doubt, is very
commonly the operation of credit: interest of money, here, comes
in, to indemnify the giver of credit, for the use of his money:
but this interest is only due from the time the borrower pays those
from whom he collects, to the time he receives payment from those
to whom he sells. This interval it is of the highest importance
to the merchant to shorten. In proportion as it is long, and in
proportion to the rate of interest, he must raise his profits; and in
proportion as payments are quick and regular, and interest low,
he may diminish them. Whether merchants do regulate their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>profits, in all commercial nations, according to the exact proportion
of the respective rates of interest, and promptitude of payments
among them; or whether these are determined by the circumstances
of demand and competition in the several foreign markets
where the trade is carried on, I leave to merchants to determine.
All I shall remark is, that a well founded credit, and
prompt payments, will do more service to trade, than any advantage
trading men can reap from the different rate of interest in
different countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must not be concluded from this, that low interest is not a
very great advantage to trade; all I contend for, is, that it is not
the barometer of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another circumstance which puts nations, in our days, much
more on a level than they were in former times, I have already
hinted at. It is <em>that general average</em> which the great loads of national
debts, and the extension of credit, through the several nations of
Europe, who pay annually large sums of interest to their creditors,
has established. Let me suppose the Dutch, for example, to have
fixed, by placard, the rate of their interest at 3 <i>per cent.</i> I say, that
so soon as the <em>general average</em> of interest comes to stand above that
rate, from the price of public funds in England and France, we
may safely conclude, that their trade cannot be carried on with
any very considerable sum of money borrowed at 3 <i>per cent.</i> The
consequence then must be, to send the money which regorges in
the hands of the frugal Dutch, into other countries, where it can
produce a better return, exclusive of all expences of remitting and
drawing. What the consequences of this lending to foreigners
may be to Holland, shall be afterwards examined.</p>

<p class='c001'>To conclude; I believe it will be found, that what has led some
to believe that low interest is the barometer of commerce, has
been owing to this; that in some of the most commercial countries
and cities interest has been found to be lower than in great
kingdoms: but <em>that</em>, I imagine, is entirely owing to the frugality
of their manners, which cuts off the borrowing of the rich for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the sake of dissipation. When this is accomplished, trade alone
being what absorbs the stagnations of the frugal, the price of interest
will fall to that rate which is the best proportioned to the
profits upon it: but this also will be less and less the case every
day, in proportion to the credit and circulation of public funds in
different nations.</p>

<hr class='c006' />

<h4 id='ch4.1.9' class='c015'>CHAP. IX. <br /> <i>Does not Interest fall in Proportion as Wealth increases?</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>I answer in the affirmative: providing it be supposed that dissipation
does not increase in proportion to the wealth. Now
in a general proposition, such as this which stands at the head of
our chapter, that very necessary proviso is not attended to, and
thus people are led to error. It is the manners of a people, not
their external circumstances as to riches, which render them frugal
or extravagant. What, therefore, depends upon the spirit of
a people, cannot be changed, but in consequence of a change of
that spirit.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the rate of interest be high, from a taste of dissipation, let
foreign trade throw in what loads of money it may, interest will
still stand high, until manners change. Every class of a people
has their peculiar spirit. The frugal merchant will accumulate
wealth, and the prodigal lord will borrow it. In this situation,
internal circulation will be rapid, and lands will shift hands.
If this revolution should prove a corrective to dissipation, by vesting
property in those who have contracted a firm habit of frugality,
then an augmentation of wealth may sink the rate of interest.
But if, on the contrary, the laws and manners of the
country do distinguish classes by their manner of living, and mode
of expence, it is ten to one that the industrious and frugal merchant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>will put on the prodigal gentleman, the moment he gets
into a fine country seat, and hears himself called Your honour.
In certain countries, the memory of past industry carries a dreg
along with it, which nothing but expensive living has power to
purge away.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let this suffice at present upon the subject of interest: it is so
connected with the doctrine of credit, that it will recur again at
almost every step as we go along.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PART II. <br /> OF BANKS.</h3>

<hr class='c014' />

<h4 id='ch4.2.1' class='c020'>CHAP. I. <br /> <i>Of the various Kinds of Credit.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We have already pointed out the nature of credit, which is
confidence; and we have deduced the principles which
influence the rate of interest, the essential requisite for its support.</p>

<p class='c001'>We come now to treat of domestic circulation; where we are to
deduce the principles of banking. This is the great engine calculated
for carrying it on.</p>

<p class='c001'>That I may, with order, investigate the many combinations we
shall here meet with, I must point out wherein banks differ from
one another in point of policy, as well as in the principle upon which
their credit is built.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we consider them relative to their policy, I divide them into
banks of circulation, and banks of deposit. This every one understands.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>If according to their principle, they are established either on <em>private</em>,
or <em>mercantile</em>, or <em>public credit</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This last division I must attend to in the distribution of what is to
follow; and therefore it is proper to set out by explaining what I
understand by the terms I have here introduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Private credit. This is established upon a security, real or
personal, of value sufficient to make good the obligation of repayment
both of capital and interest. This is the most solid of all.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, Mercantile credit. This is established upon the confidence
the lender has, that the borrower, from his integrity and knowledge
in trade, may be able to replace the capital advanced, and the
interest due during the advance, in terms of the agreement. This
is the most precarious of all.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, Public credit. This is established upon the confidence reposed
in a state, or body politic, who borrow money upon condition
that the capital shall not be demandable; but that a certain proportional
part of the sum shall be annually paid, either in lieu of interest,
or in extinction of part of the capital; for the security of
which, a permanent annual fund is appropriated, with a liberty,
however, to the state to liberate itself at pleasure, upon repaying
the whole; when nothing to the contrary is stipulated.</p>

<p class='c001'>The solidity of this species of credit depends upon circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference between the three kinds of credit lies more in the
object of the confidence, and the nature of the security, than in the
condition of the borrower. Either a private man, a merchant, or
a state, may pledge, for the security of a loan, a real or a moveable
security, with an obligation to refund the capital. In this case, the
obligation stands upon the solid basis of private credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Either a private man, a merchant, or a state, may strike out projects
which carry a favourable appearance of success, and thereupon
borrow considerable sums of money, repayable with interest. In
this case, the obligation stands upon a mercantile credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Either a private man, a merchant, or a state, may pledge (for the
security of money borrowed) a perpetual annual income, the fund
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>of which is not their property, without any obligation to refund the
capital: such obligations stand upon the principles of public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>I allow there is a great resemblance between the three species of
credit here enumerated: there are however some characteristic differences
between them.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, In the difficulty of establishing and supporting them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Private credit is inseparable, in some degree, from human society.
We find it subsisting in all ages: the security is palpable, and the
principles on which it is built are simple and easy to be comprehended.
Public credit is but a late invention: it is the infant of commerce,
and of extensive circulation. It has supplied the place of the
treasures of old, which were constant and ready resources to statesmen
in cases of public distress: the security is not palpable, nor readily
understood, by the multitude; as it rests upon the liability of certain
fundamental maxims of government. Mercantile credit is
still more difficult to establish; because the security is the most precarious
of any: it depends upon opinion and speculation, more
than upon a fund provided for repayment of either capital or interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, They differ in the nature of the security and object of confidence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Private credit has a determinate object of confidence, viz. the
real existence of value in the hands of the debtor, sufficient to satisfy
both capital and interest. Public credit has the visible security of a
fund appropriated for the perpetual payment of the interest. Mercantile
credit depends wholly upon the integrity, capacity, and
good fortune of the debtor.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The third difference is with regard to the <a id='corr143.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='case'>ease</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_143.27'><ins class='correction' title='case'>ease</ins></a></span> of transfer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public debts stand generally on the same bottom. No part of the
same fund is better than another: the price of them is publicly
known, and the securities are laid in the most convenient way for
transfer, that is, circulation, without consent of the debtor. This
is far from being the case in private securities. Nor is it the case
in the mercantile, except in bills payable to order, in which case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>alone, the creditor can effectually transfer without the consent of
the debtor.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, The fourth difference is discovered in the stability of the confidence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing can shake private credit, but an appearance of insolvency
in the very debtor. But the bankruptcy of one considerable
merchant, will give a very great shock to mercantile credit over all
Europe: and nothing will hurt public credit, so long as the stipulated
interest continues regularly to be paid, and so long as the
funds appropriated for that payment remain entire.</p>

<p class='c001'>From what has been said, I hope the three species of credit have
been sufficiently explained; and from what is to follow, we shall
feel the utility of this distribution.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.2' class='c015'>CHAP. II. <br /> <i>Of private Credit.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Private credit is either real, personal, or mixed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Real security or credit, every body understands. It is the
object of law, not of politics, to give an enumeration of its different
branches. By this term, we understand no more than the
pledging an immoveable subject for the payment of a debt. As
by a personal security we understand the engagement of the debtor’s
whole effects for the relief of his creditors. The mixed, I have
found it necessary to superadd, in order to explain with more facility,
the security of one species of banks. The notes issued by
banks upon private credit, stand upon a mixed security: that is,
both real and personal. Personal, so far as they affect the banker,
and the banking stock pledged for the security of the paper: and
in the second place, upon the securities, real and personal, granted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to the banker for the notes he lends, which afterwards enter into
circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ruling principles in private credit, and the basis on which it
rests, is the facility of converting, into money, the effects of the
debtor; because the capital and interest are constantly supposed to
be demandable. The proper way, therefore, to support this sort of
credit to the utmost, is to contrive a ready method of appretiating
every subject affectable by debts; and secondly, of melting it down
into symbolical or paper money.</p>

<p class='c001'>In former times, when circulation was confined, the scheme of
melting down the property of debtors, for the payment of creditors,
was impracticable; and accordingly we see that capitals secured on
land property were not demandable. This formed another species
of credit, different from any we have mentioned; which only differed
from public credit in this, that the solid property producing
the income, was really in the hands of the debtor. This subdivision
we have omitted, as its basis rests solely upon the regular payment
of the interest. Of this nature are the contracts of constitution in
France, and the old infeftments of annual rent in Scotland. There
are few nations, I believe, in Europe, where a vestige, at least, of
this kind of security does not remain.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order, then, to carry private credit to its greatest extent, all
entails upon lands should be dissolved; all obligations should be
regularly recorded in public registers; the value of all lands should
be ascertained, the moment any security is granted upon them;
and the statesman should interpose between parties, to accelerate
the liquidation of all debts, in the shortest time, and at the least
expence possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although this method of proceeding be the most effectual to
secure, and to extend private credit, yet it is not, at all times, expedient
to have recourse to it; as we have abundantly explained in
the 27th chapter of the second book; and therefore I shall not here
interrupt my subject with a needless repetition.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h4 id='ch4.2.3' class='c015'>CHAP. III. <br /> <i>Of Banks.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In deducing the principles of banks, I shall do the best I can to go
through the subject systematically.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have divided credit into three branches, private, mercantile,
and public. This distribution will be of use on many occasions,
and shall be followed as far as it will go, consistently with perspicuity:
but as I have often observed of subjects of a complex nature,
they cannot be brought under the influence of a few general principles,
without running into the modern vice of forming systems,
by wire-drawing many relations in order to make them answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great operations of domestic circulation are better discovered
by an examination of the principles upon which we find
banking established, than by any other method I can contrive. It
has been by inquiry into the nature of those banks which are
the most remarkable in Europe, that I have gathered the little
knowledge I have of the theory of circulation. This induces me
to think that the best way of communicating my thoughts on that
subject, is to lay down the result of my inquiries relative to the
very object of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>After comparing the operations of different banks in promoting
circulation, I find I can divide them, as to their policy, into two
general classes, viz. those which issue notes payable in coin to bearer;
and those which only transfer the credit written down in their books
from one person to another.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those which issue notes, I call banks of circulation; those which
transfer their credit, I call banks of deposit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both indeed may be called banks of circulation, because by their
means circulation is facilitated; but as different terms serve to distinguish
ideas different in themselves, those I here employ, will answer
the purpose as well as any others, when once they are defined;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and circulation undoubtedly reaps far greater advantages from
banks which issue notes transferable every where, than from banks
which only transfer their credit on the very spot where the books
are kept.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall, according to this distribution, first explain the principles
upon which the banks of circulation are constituted and conducted,
before I treat of the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>This will lead me to avail myself of the division I have made of
credit, into private, mercantile, and public: because, according to
the purposes for which a bank is established, the ground of confidence,
that is, the credit of the bank, is settled upon one or other
of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>In countries where trade and industry are in their infancy, credit
must be little known; and they who have solid property, find the
greatest difficulty in turning it into money, without which industry
cannot be carried on, as we have abundantly explained in the 26th
chapter of the second book; and consequently the whole plan of
improvement is disappointed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under such circumstances, it is proper to establish a bank upon
the principles of private credit. This bank must issue notes upon
land and other securities, and the profits of it must arise from the
permanent interest drawn for the money lent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this nature are the banks of Scotland. To them the improvement
of that country is entirely owing; and until they are generally
established in other countries of Europe, where trade and industry
are little known, it will be very difficult to set those great
engines to work.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although I have represented this species of banks, which I shall
call <em>banks of circulation upon mortgage</em>, as peculiarly well adapted to
countries where industry and trade are in their infancy, their usefulness
to all nations, who have upon an average a favourable balance
upon their trade, will sufficiently appear upon an examination
of the principles upon which they are established.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>It is for this reason, that I have applied myself to reduce to principles
all the operations of the Scotch banks, while they were in
the greatest distress imaginable, from the heavy balance the country
owed during the last years of the late war, and for some time
after the peace in 1763. By this I flatter myself to do a particular
service to Scotland, as well as to suggest hints which may prove
useful, not only to England, but to all commercial countries, who,
by imitating this establishment, will reap advantages of which they
are at present deprived.</p>

<p class='c001'>For these reasons, I hope the detail I shall enter into with regard
to Scotland, will not appear tedious, both from the variety of curious
combinations it will contain, as also from the lights it will
cast upon the whole doctrine of circulation, which is the present
object of our attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>In countries where trade is established, industry flourishing, credit
extensive, circulation copious and rapid, as in England, banks
upon mortgage, however useful they may prove for other purposes,
would not answer the demands of the trade of London, and the
service of government, so well as the bank of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ruling principle of that bank, and the ground of their confidence,
is mercantile credit. The bank of England does not lend
upon mortgage, nor personal security: their profits arise from discounting
bills; loans to government, upon the faith of taxes, to be
paid within the year and upon the credit cash of those who deal
with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>A bank such as that of England, cannot therefore be established,
except in a great wealthy mercantile city, where the accumulation
of the smallest profits amount, at the end of the year, to very considerable
sums.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France, under the regency of the Duke of Orleans, there was
a bank erected upon the principles of public credit. The ground
of confidence there, and the only security for all the paper they
issued, were the funds appropriated for the payment of the interest
of the public debts.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>It is for the sake of order and method, that I propose to explain
the principles of banking, according to this distribution. I must
however confess, that although I represent each of them as having
a cause of confidence peculiar to itself, to wit, either private, mercantile,
or public credit; yet we shall find a mixture of all the three
species of credit entring into the combination of every one of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Banking, in the age we live, is that branch of credit which best
deserves the attention of a statesman. Upon the right establishment
of banks, depends the <a id='corr149.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='property'>prosperity</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_149.9'><ins class='correction' title='property'>prosperity</ins></a></span> of trade, and the equable course of
circulation. By them <a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a><em>solid property</em> may be melted down. By the
means of banks, money may be constantly kept at a due proportion
to alienation. If alienation increases, more property may be melted
down. If it diminishes, the quantity of money stagnating, will be
absorbed by the bank, and part of the property formerly melted
down in the securities granted to them, will be, as it were, consolidated
anew. These must pay for the country the balance of their
trade with foreign nations. These keep the mints at work; and it
is by their means, principally, that private, mercantile, and public
credit, is supported. I can point out the utility of banks in no way
so striking, as to recall to mind the surprizing effects of Mr. Law’s
bank, established in France, at a time when there was neither money
or credit in the kingdom. The superior genius of that man
produced, in two years time, the most surprizing effects imaginable;
he revived industry; he established confidence; and shewed to
the world, that while the landed property of a nation is in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>hands of the inhabitants; and while the lower classes are willing
to be industrious, money never <em>can</em> be wanting. I must now proceed
in order, towards the investigation of the principles which
influence this intricate and complicated branch of my subject.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Solid property, here, is not taken in the strictest acceptation. In countries of
commerce, where banks are generally established, every denomination of good personal
security, may be considered as solid property. Those who have personal estates
may obtain credit from banks as well as landed men; because these personal estates
are secured either on lands, or in the funds, or in effects which contain as real a value
as lands, and these being affected by the securities which the proprietors grant to the
bank, may with as much propriety be said to be melted down, as if they consisted in
lands. In subjects of this nature, it is necessary to extend our combinations, in proportion
to the circumstances under which we reason.</p>
</div>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.4' class='c015'>CHAP. IV. <br /><i>Of Banks of Circulation upon Mortgage or private Credit.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Banks of circulation upon mortgage or private credit, are
those which issue notes upon private security, payable to bearer
on demand, in the current coin of the nation. They are constituted
in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>A number of men of property join together in a contract of banking,
either ratified or not by public authority, according to circumstances.
For this purpose, they form a stock which may consist
indifferently of any species of property. This fund is engaged to
all the creditors of the company, as a security for the notes they
propose to issue. So soon as confidence is established with the public,
they grant credits, or cash accompts, upon good security; concerning
which they make the proper regulations. In proportion
to the notes issued in consequence of those credits, they provide a
sum of coin, such as they judge to be sufficient to answer such notes
as shall return upon them for payment. Nothing but experience
can enable them to determine the proportion between the coin to
be kept in their coffers, and the paper in circulation. This proportion
even varies according to circumstances, as we shall afterwards
observe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The profits of the bank proceed from the interest paid upon all
the securities which have been granted to it, in consequence of credits
given, and which remain with it unretired.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Out of which must be deducted, first, the charge of management;
secondly, the loss of interest for all the coin they preserve in their
coffers, as well as the expence they are put to in providing it; and
thirdly, the expence of transacting and paying all balances due to
other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>In proportion, therefore, as the interest upon the bank securities
exceeds the loss of interest on the coin in the bank, the expence of
management, and of providing funds abroad to pay balances, in
the same proportion is their profit; which they may either divide,
accumulate, or employ, as they think fit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let it be observed, that I do not consider the original bank stock,
or the interest arising from <em>that</em>, as any part of the profits of the
bank. So far as regards the bank, it is their original property; and
so far as regards the public, it serves for a collateral security to it,
for the notes issued. It becomes a pledge, as it were, for the faithful
discharge of the trust reposed in the bank: without such a
pledge, the public could have no security to indemnify it, in case
the bank should issue notes for no permanent value received. This
would be the case, if they thought fit to issue their paper either in
payment of their own private debts, for articles of present consumption;
or in precarious trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>When paper is issued for no value received, the security of such
paper stands alone upon the original capital of the bank, whereas
when it is issued for value received, that value is the security on
which it immediately stands, and the bank stock is, properly speaking,
only subsidiary.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have dwelt the longer upon this circumstance, because many,
who are unacquainted with the nature of banks, have a difficulty
to comprehend how they should ever be at a loss for money, as
they have a mint of their own, which requires nothing but paper
and ink to create millions. But if they consider the principles of
banking, they will find that every note issued for value consumed,
in place of value received and preserved, is neither more or less,
than a partial spending either of their capital, or profits on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>bank. Is not this the effect of the expence of their management?
Is not this expence paid in their notes? But did ever any
body imagine that this expence did not diminish the profits of
banking? Consequently, such expence may exhaust these profits, if
carried far enough; and if carried still farther, will diminish the
capital of the banking stock.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a farther illustration of this principle, let me suppose, an honest
man, intelligent, and capable to undertake a bank. I say that
such a person, without one shilling of stock, may carry on a bank
of domestic circulation, to as good purpose as if he had a million;
and his paper will be every bit as good as that of the bank of England.
Every note he issues, is secured on good private security;
that security carries interest to him, and stands good for the notes
he has issued. Suppose then that after having issued for a million
sterling, all the notes should return upon him in one day. Is it not
plain, that they will find, with the honest banker, the original
securities, taken by him at the time he issued them; and is it not
true, that he will have, belonging to himself, the interest received
upon these securities, while his notes were in circulation, except
so far as this interest has been spent in carrying on the business of
his bank? Large bank stocks, therefore, serve only to establish their
credit; to secure the confidence of the public, who cannot see into
their administration; but who willingly believe, that men who
have considerable property pledged in security of <a id='corr152.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='that'>their</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_152.24'><ins class='correction' title='that'>their</ins></a></span> good faith,
will not probably deceive them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This stock is the more necessary, from the obligation of paying
in the metals. Coin may be wanting, upon some occasions, to men
of the greatest landed property. Is that any reason to suspect their
credit? Just so of banks. The bank of England may be possessed of
twenty millions sterling of good effects, to wit, their capital; and
the securities for all the notes they have issued; and yet that bank
might be obliged to stop payment, upon a sudden demand of a few
millions of coin.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Runs upon a bank well established, betray great want of confidence
in the public; and this want of confidence proceeds from the
ignorance the greatest part of men are in, with regard to the state
of their affairs, and of the principles upon which their trade is
carried on.</p>

<p class='c001'>From what has been said, we may conclude, that the solidity of
a bank which lends upon private security, does not so much depend
upon the extent of their original capital, as upon the regulations
they observe in granting credit. In this the public is nearly interested;
because the bank securities are really taken for the public,
who are creditors upon it in virtue of the notes which circulate
through their hands.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.5' class='c015'>CHAP. V. <br /> <i>Such Banks ought to issue their Notes on private, not mercantile Credit.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Let me, therefore, reason upon the example of two bankers;
one issues his notes upon the best real or personal security;
another gives credit to merchants and manufacturers, upon the principles
of mercantile credit, which we have explained above; the notes
of the one and the other enter into circulation, and the question comes
to be, which are the best? If we judge by the regularity of the
payment of notes on presentation, perhaps the one are as readily
paid as the other. If we judge by the stock of the two bankers,
perhaps they may be equal, both in value and solidity; but it is not
upon either of these circumstances that the question depends. The
notes in circulation may far exceed the amount of the largest bank
stock; and therefore, it is not on the original stock; but on the
securities taken at issuing the notes, that the solidity of the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>currencies is to be estimated. Those secured on private credit, are
as solid as lands and personal estates; they stand upon the principles
of private credit. Those secured on the obligations of merchants
and manufacturers, depending upon the success of their
trade, are good or bad in proportion. Every bankruptcy of one
of their debtors, involves the bank, and carries off either a part of
their profits, or of their stock. Which way, therefore, can the public
judge of the affairs of bankers, except by attending to the nature
of the securities upon which they give credit<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. It must be observed, that in this example, the banker who issues his notes upon
mercantile security, is supposed to grant a permanent loan to the merchant or manufacturer,
as he would do to those who pledge a personal security. This is totally
repugnant to the principle of banks secured on mercantile credit. Such banks never
grant loans for indefinite duration, upon any security whatsoever. They will not even
discount a bill of exchange, when it has above two months to run.</p>
</div>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.6' class='c015'>CHAP. VI. <br /> <i>Use of subaltern Bankers and Exchangers.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Here it may be urged, that the great use of banks is to multiply
circulation, and to furnish the industrious with the
means of carrying on their traffic: that if banks insist upon the
most solid sureties before they give credit, the great utility of them
must cease; because merchants and manufacturers are never in a
situation to obtain credit upon such terms.</p>

<p class='c001'>This argument only proves, that banks are not, alone, sufficient
for carrying on every branch of circulation. A truth which no
body will contravert. But as they are of use in carrying on the
great branches of circulation, it is proper to prevent them from
engaging in schemes which may destroy their credit altogether.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>I have observed above, that this method of issuing notes upon
private security, was peculiarly well adapted to countries like Scotland,
where trade and industry are in their infancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Merchants and manufacturers there, have constant occasion for
money or credit; and at the same time, they cannot be supposed
to have either real or personal estates to pledge, in order to obtain
a loan directly from the banks, who ought to lend upon no other
security.</p>

<p class='c001'>To remove that difficulty, we find a set of merchants, men of
substance, who obtain from the banks very extensive credits upon
the joint real and personal security of themselves and friends. With
this assistance from the bank, and with money borrowed from private
people, repayable on demand, something below the common
rate of interest, they support the trade of Scotland, by giving credit
to the merchants and manufacturers.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this set of men, therefore, are banks of circulation upon
mortgage to leave that particular branch of business. It is their
duty, it is the interest of the country, and no less that of banks,
that they be supported in so useful a trade; a trade which animates
all the commerce and manufactures of Scotland, and which consequently
promotes the circulation of those very notes upon which
the profits of the banks do arise.</p>

<p class='c001'>These merchants are settled in all the most considerable towns:
they are well acquainted with the stock, capacity, industry, and
integrity of all the dealers in their district: they are many; and by
this are able to go through all the detail which their business
requires; and their profits, as we shall see presently, are greater
than those of banks, who lend at a stated interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The common denomination by which they are called in Scotland,
is that of bankers; but to avoid their being confounded with
bankers in England (whose business is very different) we shall,
while we are treating of the doctrine of banks, call them by the
name of exchangers, since their trade is principally carried on by
bills of exchange.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>As often as these exchangers give credit to dealers in any way,
they constantly state a commission of ½ <i>per cent.</i> or more, according
to circumstances, over and above the interest of their <a id='corr156.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='advance-profits,'>advance; profits</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_156.4'><ins class='correction' title='advance-profits,'>advance; profits</ins></a></span>
which greatly surpass those of any bank. One thousand
pounds credit given by a bank, may not produce ten pounds
in a year for interest: if given by a banker, to a merchant, who
draws it out, and replaces it forty times in a year, there will arise
upon it a commission of 20 <i>per cent.</i> or 200<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>This set of men are exposed to risks and losses, which they bear
without complaint, because of their great profits; but it implies
a detail, which no bank can descend to.</p>

<p class='c001'>These exchangers give way, from time to time; and no essential
hurt is thereby occasioned to national credit. The loss falls
upon those who lend to them, or trust them with their money,
upon precarious security; and upon merchants, who lay their account
with such risks. In a word, they are a kind of insurers,
and draw premiums in proportion to their risks.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this set of men, therefore, it should be left to give credit to
merchants, as the credit they give is purely mercantile; and to
banks alone, who give credit on good private security, it should be
left to conduct the great national circulation, which ought to
stand upon the solid principles of private credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this example we may discover the justness of the distinction
I have made between <em>private</em> and <em>mercantile</em> credit: had I not found
it necessary, I would not have introduced it.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.2.7' class='c015'>CHAP. VII. <br /> <i>Concerning the Obligation to pay in Coin, and the Consequences thereof.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In all banks of circulation upon mortgage, the obligation in the
note is to pay in coin, upon demand: and in the famous book
of Mr. Law, there was a very necessary clause added; to wit, that
the coin was to be of the same weight, fineness, and denomination,
as at the date of the note. This was done, in order to prevent the
inconveniencies which might result to either party, by an arbitrary
raising or sinking the denominations of the coin; a practice
then very familiar in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>This obligation to pay in coin, owes its origin to the low state
of credit in Europe at the time when banks first began to be introduced;
and it is not likely that any other expedient will soon
be fallen upon to remove the inconveniences which result from
it in domestic circulation, as long as the generality of people consider
all money, except coin, to be false and fictitious.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have already thrown out abundance of hints, from which it
may be gathered, that coin is not absolutely necessary for carrying
on domestic circulation, and more will be said on that subject, as
we go along. But I am here to examine the nature and consequences
of this obligation contracted by banks, to discharge their
notes in the current coin of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, it is plain, that no coin is ever (except in very
particular cases) carried to a bank, in order to procure notes. The
greatest part of notes issue from the banks, of which we are treating,
either in consequence of a loan, or of a credit given by the
bank, to such as can give security for them. The loan is made in
their own notes; which are quickly thrown <a id='corr157.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title=''>back</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_157.26'><ins class='correction' title=''>back</ins></a></span> into circulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>by the borrower; who borrowed, because he had occasion to pay
them away. In like manner, when a credit is given, the bank
pays (in her notes) the orders she receives from the person who
has the credit: in this manner are notes commonly issued from a
bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coin, again, comes to a bank, in the common course of circulation,
by payments made to it, either for the interest upon their
loans, or when merchants and landed men throw the payments
made to them into the bank, towards filling up their credits; and
by way of a safe deposit for their money. These payments are
made to the bank in the ordinary circulation of the country. When
there is a considerable proportion of coin in circulation, then the
bank receives much coin; and when there is little, they receive
little. Whatever they receive is laid by to answer notes which are
offered for payment; but whenever a draught is made upon them
for the money thrown in as above, they pay in paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we are here searching after <a id='corr158.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='the'></ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_158.17'><ins class='correction' title='the'></ins></a></span> principles, not after facts, it
is out of our way to inquire what may be the real proportion of coin
preserved by banks of circulation, for answering the demand for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Megens, a very knowing man, and a very judicious author,
lately dead, who has writ a small treatise in the German tongue,
translated into English, under the title of <cite>The Universal Merchant</cite>,
delivers his sentiments concerning the proportion of coin preserved
in the bank of England, which I shall here transcribe in the translator’s
words. Sect. 60.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank of England consists of two sorts of creditors, the one of
that set of men, who, in King William’s time, when money was
scarce and dear, lent the public 1,200,000 pounds, at 8 <i>per cent.</i> interest,
and 4000 pounds were allowed them for charges, amounting
in whole to 100,000 pounds a year, an exclusive right of banking
as a corporation for 13 years, under the denomination of the proprietors
of the bank; and which, for obtaining prolongation of
their privileges, has been since increased by farther loans to the
public at a less interest, to near the sum of 11,000,000 pounds, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>if we compute the interest at 3 <i>per cent.</i> (as what they have more on
some part answers incident charges) it produces 330,000 pounds a
year; and as they divide annually 5 <i>per cent.</i> to their proprietors,
which, is 550,000 pounds, it is evident that they make a yearly profit
of 220,000 pounds, <em>out of the money of the people who keep cash with them</em>,
and these are the other sort of creditors: and as for what money
the bank lends to the government, they have for the most part but
3 <i>per cent.</i> interest, I conclude that <em>the credit cash they have in their
hands</em> may amount to 11,000,000 pounds, and thereout is employed
in loans to the government, discounting of bills, and in buying
gold and silver 7,333,333⅓ pounds, which at 3 <i>per cent.</i> interest or
profit, will amount to the above 220,000 pounds, and remains
3,666,666⅔ pounds in cash, sufficient for circulation and current
payments. And experience has evinced, that whenever any mistrust
has occasioned any run upon the bank for any continuance,
and the people not finding the treasure so soon exhausted as they
surmised, it flowed in again faster on the one hand than it was
drawn out on the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>This gentleman lived long in England. He was very intelligent
in matters relating to commerce; and his authority may, I believe,
be relied on as much as on any other, except that of the bank itself;
which, it would appear, has some interest in keeping those affairs
a secret.</p>

<p class='c001'>We see by his account, that the bank of England keeps in coin
⅓ of the value of all their notes in circulation. With this quantity,
business is carried on with great smoothness, owing to the prosperity
of that kingdom, which seldom owes any considerable balance to
other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the consequence of the obligation to pay in coin, is, that
when the nation comes to owe a balance, the notes which the bank
had issued to support domestic circulation <em>only</em>, come upon it
for payment of a foreign balance; and thereby the coin which it
had provided for home demand only, is drawn out.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>It is this circumstance, above all others, which distresses banks
of circulation. Were it not for this, the obligation to pay in coin
might easily be discharged; but when in virtue of this pure obligation,
a heavy national balance is demanded of the bank, which
has only made provision for the current and ordinary demand at
home, it requires a little combination to find out, at once, an easy
remedy.</p>

<p class='c001'>This combination we shall, in the following chapters, endeavour
to unfold: it is by far the most intricate, and at the same time the
most important in the whole doctrine of banks of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another inconvenience resulting from this obligation to pay in
coin, we have explained in the third book. It is, that the confusion
of the English coin, and the lightness of a great part of it, obliges
the bank of England to purchase the metals at a price far above
that which they can draw back for them after they are coined. We
have there shewn the great profit that might be made in melting
down and exporting the heavy species. This profit turns out a real
loss to the bank of England, which is constantly obliged to provide
new coin, in proportion as it is wanted. This inconvenience is not
directly felt by banks, in countries where there is no mint established.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here then is another bad consequence of this obligation to pay in
the metals, which a proper regulation of the coin would immediately
remove. In countries which abound in coin, banking is an
easy trade, when once their credit is well established. It is only
when either a foreign war, or a wrong balance of trade has carried
off the metals, that the weight of this obligation to pay in coin is
severely felt.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h4 id='ch4.2.8' class='c015'>CHAP. VIII. <br /> <i>How a wrong Balance of Trade affects Banks of Circulation.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is commonly said, that when there is a balance due by any
nation, upon the whole of their mercantile transactions with the
rest of the world, such balance must be paid in coin. This we call
a wrong balance. Those who transact the payment of this balance,
are those who regulate the course of exchange; and we may suppose,
without the least danger of being deceived, that the course
is always higher than the expence of procuring and transporting
the metals; because the overcharge is profit to the exchanger, who
without that profit could not carry on his business.</p>

<p class='c001'>These exchangers, then, must have a command of coin; and
where can they get it so easily, and so readily, as from banks who
are bound to pay in it?</p>

<p class='c001'>Every merchant who imports foreign commodities, must be supposed
to have value in his hands from the sale of them; but this
value must consist in the money of the country: if that be mostly
bank paper, he must give the bank paper to the exchangers for a
bill, whose business it is to place funds in those parts upon which
bills are demanded. The exchanger again (to support that fund
which he exhausts by his draughts) must demand coin from the
banks, for the notes he received from the merchant when he gave
him the foreign bill.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the wrong balances of trade transacted in this manner,
which banks are constantly obliged to make good in coin, every
other payment made to foreigners has the same effect. It is not
because it is a <em>balance of trade</em>, but because it is a payment which
cannot be made in paper currency, that a demand is made for coin.
Coin we have called the money of the world, as notes may be called
the money of the society. The first then must be procured when we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>pay a balance to foreigners; the last is full as good when we pay
among ourselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is proper, however, to observe, that there is a great difference
between the wrong <em>balance of trade</em>, and the general <em>balance of payments</em>.
The first marks the total loss of the nation when her imports
exceed the value of her exports; the second comprehends three other
articles, viz. 1. the expence of the natives in foreign countries;
2. the payment of all debts, principal and interest, due to foreigners;
3. the lending to other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>These three I call the general balance of foreign payments: and
these added to the wrong balance of trade may be called the <em>grand
balance</em> with the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now as long as the payment of this <em>grand balance</em> is negotiated by
exchangers, all the coin required to make it good, must be at the
charge of banks.</p>

<p class='c001'>How then is this coin to be procured by nations who have no
mines of their own?</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.9' class='c015'>CHAP. IX. <br /><i>How a grand Balance may be paid by Banks, without the assistance of Coin.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Did all the circulation of a country consist in coin, this <em>grand
balance</em>, as we have called it, would be paid out of the coin,
to the diminution of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said that the acquisition of coin, or of the precious
metals, adds to the intrinsic value of a country, as much as if a portion
of territory were added to it. The truth of this proposition will
now soon appear evident.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>We have also said, that the creation of symbolical money, adds
no additional wealth to a country, but only provides a fund of circulation
out of solid property; which enables the proprietors to
consume and to pay proportionally for their consumption: and we
have shewn how by this contrivance trade and industry are made
to flourish.</p>

<p class='c001'>May we not conclude, from these principles, that as nations who
have coin, pay their <em>grand balance</em> out of their coin, to the diminution
of that species of their property, so nations who have melted down
their solid property into symbolical money, must pay their <em>grand
balance</em> out of the symbolical money; that is to say, out of the solid
property of which it is the symbol?</p>

<p class='c001'>But this solid property cannot be sent abroad; and it is alleged
that nothing but coin can be employed in paying this <em>grand balance</em>.
To this I answer, that in such a case the credit of a bank may step
in, without which a nation which runs short of coin, and which
comes to owe a <em>grand balance</em> must quickly be undone.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said that while exchangers transact the balance, the
whole load of providing coin lies upon banks. Now the whole
solid property melted down, in their paper, is in their hands; because
I consider the securities given them for their paper, to be the
same as the property itself. Upon this property, there is a yearly
interest paid to the bank: this interest, then, must be engaged by
them to foreigners, in lieu of what is owing to them by the nation;
and when once a fund is borrowed upon it abroad, the rest is easy
to the bank. This shall be further explained as we go along.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not pretend that the common operation of providing coin,
when the <em>grand balance</em> is against a nation, is as simple as I have
represented it. I know it is not: and I know also, that I am not
in any degree capable to explain the infinite combination of mercantile
operations necessary to bring it about; but it is no less true,
that these combinations may be shortened: because when the whole
of them have been gone through, the transaction must land in
what I have said; to wit, that either the <em>grand balance</em> must be paid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>out of the national stock of coin, or it must be furnished by foreigners
upon a loan from them; the interest of which must be
paid out of that part of the solid property of the nation which has
been melted down into paper. I say farther, that were not all this
solid property, so melted down, in the hands of banks, who
thereby have established to themselves an enormous <em>mercantile</em> credit;
there would be no possibility of conducing such an operation:
that is to say, there would be no possibility for nations to run
in debt to nations, upon the security of their respective landed
property.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.10' class='c015'>CHAP. X. <br /> <i>Insufficiency of temporary Credits for the Payment of a wrong Balance.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>I have said, that when the national stock of coin is not sufficient
to provide banks with the quantity demanded of them, for
the payment of the <em>grand balance</em>, that a loan must take place. To
this it may be objected, that a credit is sufficient to procure coin,
without having recourse to a formal loan. The difference I make
between a loan and a credit consists in this, that, by a credit we
understand a temporary advance of money, which the person who
gives the credit expects to have repaid in a short time, with interest
for the advance, and commission for the credit; whereas by a
loan we understand the lending of money for an indefinite time,
with interest during non-payment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now I say, the credit, in this case, will not answer the purpose
of supplying a deficiency of coin; unless the deficiency has been
accidental, and that a return of coin, from a new favourable <em>grand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>balance</em>, be quickly expected. The credit will indeed answer the
present exigency; but the moment this credit comes to be replaced,
it must be replaced either by a loan, or by a supply of coin; but,
by the supposition, coin is found to be wanting for paying the
<em>grand balance</em>; consequently, nothing but a loan, made by the lenders
either in coin, in the metals, or in a liberty to draw, can remove
the inconvenience; and if recourse be had to credit, instead
of the loan, the same difficulty will recur, whenever that credit
comes to be made good by repayment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the whole, we may conclude, that nations who owe a
balance to other nations, must pay it either with their coin, or with
solid property; consequently, the acquisition of coin is, in this
particular, as advantageous as the acquisition of lands; but when
coin is not to be procured, the transmission of the solid property to
foreign creditors is an operation which banks must undertake; because
it is they who are obliged either to do that, or to pay in coin.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.11' class='c015'>CHAP. XI. <br /><i>Of the Hurt resulting to Banks, when they leave the Payment of a wrong Balance to Exchangers.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We have seen in a former chapter, how exchangers and banks
are mutually assistant to one another: the exchangers by
swelling and supporting circulation; the bank by supplying them
with credit for that purpose. While parties are united by a common
interest, all goes well: but interest divides, by the same principle
that it unites.</p>

<p class='c001'>No sooner does a nation incur a balance against itself, than exchangers
set themselves to work to make a fortune, by conducting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the operation of paying it. They appear then in the light of political
usurers, to a spendthrift heir who has no guardian. The
guardian should be the bank, who, upon such occasions, (and
upon such only) ought to interpose between the nation and her foreign
creditors. This it may do, by constituting itself at once
debtor for the whole balance, and by taking foreign exchange into
its hand, until such time as it shall have distributed the debt it has
contracted for the nation, among those individuals who really owe
it. This operation performed, exchange may be left to those who
make that branch their business, because then they will find no
opportunity of combining either against the interest of the bank
or of individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a national bank neglects so necessary a duty, as well as
so necessary a precaution, the whole class of exchangers become
united by a common interest against it; and the country is torn to
pieces, by the fruitless attempt it makes to support itself, without
the help of the only expedient that can relieve it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those exchangers having the <em>grand balance</em> to transact with other
nations, make use of their credits with the bank, or of its notes,
to draw from it their coin, in order to export it. This throws a
great load upon the bank, which is constantly obliged to provide
a sufficient quantity for answering all demands; for we have laid
it down as a principle, that whatever coin or bills are necessary to
pay this <em>grand balance</em>, in every way it can be transacted, it must ultimately
be paid by the bank; because whoever wants coin for
any purpose, and has bank notes, can force the bank to pay in
coin, or stop payment.</p>

<p class='c001'>It cannot, therefore, be said, that exchangers do wrong; nor
can they be blamed, in drawing from the bank whatever is wanted
for the purpose of paying to foreigners what is their due; that is,
what is justly owing to them. If they do more, they must hurt
themselves; because whatever is sent abroad more than is due,
must constitute the rest of the world debtors to the country which
sends out their coin. The consequence of this is to turn exchange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>against foreigners, and to make it favourable for the nation which
is creditor. In this case, were the creditors still to continue sending
coin abroad, they would <em>lose</em> by that operation, for the same
reason that they <em>gain</em>, by sending it out when they are debtors.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is very common for banks to complain, when coin is hard to
be procured, and when large demands are made upon them; they
then allege unfair dealings against exchangers; they fall to work
to estimate the balance of trade, and endeavour to show that it is
not in reality against the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>But alas! this is nothing to the purpose; the <em>balance of trade</em> may
be very favourable, although the <em>balance of payments</em> be greatly
against the country; and both must be paid, while the bank has a
shilling of cash, or a note in circulation. So soon again as the
<em>grand balance</em> is fairly paid off, it is impossible that any one can find an
advantage in drawing coin from a bank; except in the single case
of melting down the heavy species, in nations which give their
coinage gratis. Of this we have treated at sufficient length in
another place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Banks may indeed complain, that men of property are sometimes
sending their money out of the country, at a time when it
is already drained of its coin; that this raises exchange, and hurts
the trading interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Exchange must rise, no doubt, in proportion as the grand balance
is great, and difficult to be paid: But where does the blame
lie? Who ought to provide the coin, or the bills for paying
this grand balance? Have we not shewn that it is the bank alone
who ought to provide coin for the ready answering of their notes?
Have we not said, that the method of doing this is by sacrificing
a part of the interest due upon the obligations in their hands, secured
upon the solid property of the country, and by the means of
foreign loans upon that fund, to procure either the metals themselves,
or a power to draw on those places where the nation’s creditors
reside?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Which of the two has most reason to complain, the bank, because
the inhabitants think fit to send their effects out of the country,
being either forced so to do by their creditors, or choosing so
to do for their private advantage; or the creditors of the bank, and
the country in general, when, from the obstructions the bank
throws in the way, when required to pay its notes, exchange is
forced up to an exorbitant height; the value of what private merchants
owe to strangers is raised; and when, by discouraging trade
in their hands, a general stop is put to manufactures and credit in
general?</p>

<p class='c001'>In a word, the bank has no reason to complain, unless they
can make it appear, how any person, exchanger or other, can find
an advantage in sending coin out of the country, at a time when
there is no demand for it; or when there is no near prospect of it,
which is the same thing? To say that a principle of public spirit
should prevent a person from doing with his property what is most
to his advantage, in favour of saving some money to a bank, is
supposing the bank to be the public, instead of being the servant
of the public.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another argument to prove that no profit can be made by sending
out coin, except when the balance is against a country, is, that we
see all runs upon banks stop, the moment exchange becomes favourable.
Were there a profit to be made upon sending off coin,
independently of the debts to be paid with it, which cannot be
paid without it, the same trade would be profitable at all times.
As this is not the case, it follows, that the principle we have laid
down is just; to wit, that the balance due to foreigners <em>must</em> be
paid by banks, while they have a note in circulation; and when
once it is fairly paid by them, all extraordinary demands <em>must</em> cease.</p>

<p class='c001'>We now proceed to another point, to wit, What are the consequences
<a id='corr168.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='of'>to</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_168.31'><ins class='correction' title='of'>to</ins></a></span> circulation, when a great balance draws away a large
quantity of coin from the bank, and sends it out of the country?</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>
  <h4 id='ch4.2.12' class='c015'>CHAP. XII. <br /> <i>How the Payment of a wrong Balance affects Circulation.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>That I may communicate my ideas with the greater precision,
I must here enter into a short detail of some principles,
and then reason on a supposition.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been said, that the consequence of credit and paper-money,
secured on solid property, was to augment the mass of
the circulating equivalent, in proportion to the uses found for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>These uses may be comprehended under two general heads.
The first, payment of what one owes; the second, buying what
one has occasion for: the one and the other may be called by the
general term of ready-money demands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whoever has a ready-money demand upon him, and property at
the same time, ought to be furnished with money by banks which
lend upon mortgage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the state of trade, manufactures, modes of living, and the
customary expence of the inhabitants, when taken all together, regulate
and determine what we may call the mass of ready-money
demands, that is, of alienation. To operate this multiplicity of
payments, a certain proportion of money is necessary. This proportion
again may increase or diminish according to circumstances;
although the quantity of alienation should continue the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>To make this evident, let us suppose the accounts of a whole
city kept by one man; alienation will go on without any payment
at all, until accounts are cleared; and then nothing will be paid,
but general balances upon the whole. This however is only by the
bye. The point in hand is to agree, that a certain sum of money
is necessary for carrying on domestic alienation; that is, for satisfying
ready-money demands: let us call this quantity (A).</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Next, in most countries in Europe, (I may say all) it is customary
to circulate coin, which, for many uses, is found fitter than
paper, (no matter for what reason); custom has established it, and
with custom even statesmen must comply.</p>

<p class='c001'>The paper-money is generally made payable in coin; from
custom also. Now, according to the manners of the country, more
or less coin is required for domestic circulation. Let it be observed,
that hitherto we have not attended to foreign circulation, of which
presently: and I say, that the manners of a country may make
more or less coin necessary, for circulating the same quantity of
paper; merchants, for instance, circulate much paper and little
coin; gamesters much coin, and little paper: one example is sufficient.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let this quantity of coin, necessary for circulating the paper-money,
be called (B), and let the paper be called (C); consequently
(A) will be equal to the sum of (B) and (C). Again, we
have said, that all balances owing by nation to nation, are paid
either in coin, in the metals, or in bills; and that bank paper can
be of no use in such payments. Let the quantity of the metals,
coin, or bills, going out or coming into the country for payment
of such balance, be called (D).</p>

<p class='c001'>These short designations premised, we may reason with more
precision. (A) is the total mass of money (coin and paper) necessary
at home: (A) is composed of (B) the coin, and of (C) the
paper, and (D) stands for that mass of coin, or metal, or bills,
which goes and comes according as the <em>grand balance</em> is favourable
or unfavourable with other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, from what has been said, we may determine, that there
should at all times remain in the country, or in the bank, a quantity
of coin equal to (B); and if this be ever found to fall short,
the bank does not discharge its duty. It is unnecessary to determine
what part of (B) should be locked up in the bank, and what
part should remain in circulation: banks themselves cannot determine
that question: all we need to say is, that it is the profit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>banks to accustom people to the use of paper as much as possible;
and therefore they will draw to themselves as much coin as they
can.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a favourable balance of trade brings exchange below par,
and brings coin into the country, the consequence is, either to animate
trade and industry, to augment the mass of payments, to swell
(A), and still to preserve (C) in circulation; or to make (A) regorge,
so as to sink the interest of money below the bank lending price;
and then people will carry back the regorging part of (C) to the
bank, and withdraw their securities; which is consolidating, as
we have called it, the property which had been formerly melted
down, for want of this circulating equivalent (money).</p>

<p class='c001'>This is constantly the consequence of a stagnation of paper, from
an overcharge of it, thrown into circulation. It returns upon
the bank, and diminishes the mass of their securities, but never
that of their coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we may conclude, that the circulation of a country
can only absorb a determinate quantity of money (coin and paper);
and that the less use they make of coin, the more use they will
make of paper, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may also conclude, that when trade and alienation increase,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cæteris paribus</i></span>, so will money; that is, more solid property will be
melted down; and when trade and alienation diminish, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cæteris paribus</i></span>,
so will money; that is, some of the solid property formerly
melted down, will consolidate, as we have called it.</p>

<p class='c001'>These vicissitudes in the mass of circulation are not peculiar to
paper currency. In countries where nothing circulates but the
metals, the case is the same; only the operation is more aukward
and expensive. When coin becomes scarce there, it is hardly possible,
in remote provinces, to find any credit at all: and in the
center of circulation, the use of it (interest) must rise very considerably,
and stand high for some time, before even intelligent merchants
will import bullion to the mint; which is the only bank
they have to fit it for circulation. When the metal is coined, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>men of property are enabled to borrow, or to sell their lands. On
the other hand, when a favourable balance pours in a superfluity of
coin, and at the same time cuts off the demands of trade for sending
it abroad, it frequently falls into coffers; where it becomes as
useless as if it were in the mine; and this clumsy circulation, as
I may call it, prevents it from coming into the hands of those
who would have occasion for it, did they but know where to come
at it. Paper, on the other hand, when banks and trade are well
established, is always to be found. Thus, in an instant, paper-money
either creates or extinguishes an interest equal to its value,
in favour of the possessor. No part of it lies dead, not for a day,
when employed in trade: it is not so of coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must now suppose a bank established in a country which
owes a balance to other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this case, the bank must possess, or be able to command, a
sum of coin or bills equal to (B) and (D); (B) for domestic, and
(D) for foreign circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who owe this balance (D), and who are supposed to have
value for it, in the currency of the country, in order to pay it,
must either exhaust a part of (B), by sending it away, or they must
carry a part of (C) to the bank, to be paid for in coin. If they pick
up a part of (B) in the country, then the coin in circulation, being
diminished below its proportion, the possessors of (C) will come
upon the bank for a supply, in order to make up (B) to its former
standard. Banks complain without reason. If they carry part of
(C) to be changed at the bank, for the payment of (D), they thereby
diminish the quantity of (C); consequently there will be a demand
upon the bank for more notes, to support domestic circulation;
because those which have been paid in coin are returned
to the bank, and have diminished the mass of (C); which therefore
must be replaced by a new melting down of solid property.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now I must here observe, that this recruit, issued to fill up (C)
to the level, is an addition made to the mass of securities formerly
lodged with the bank; and represents, not improperly, that part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>of the landed property of a country which the bank must dispose
of to foreigners, in order to procure from them the coin or bills
necessary for answering the demand of (D).</p>

<p class='c001'>When notes, therefore, are carried to the bank for payment of
debts due to the bank, they then diminish the mass of solid property
melted down in the securities lodged in the bank: but when
notes are carried to the bank, to be converted into coin or bills, for
foreign exportation, they do not diminish the mass of the securities:
on the contrary, the consequence is, to pave the way for the
augmentation of them; because I suppose that the notes, so given
in to the bank, and taken out of the circle, are to be replaced by
the bank to domestic circulation, to which they belonged; and
the bank must be at the expence of turning the value of these
additional securities granted for them into coin or foreign bills.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is not this quite consistent with reason, fact, and common sense?
If a country contracts debts to foreigners, is it not just the same
case as when one man contracts a debt to another in the same society?
Must not the ultimate consequence of this debt be, that
it must be paid, either with the coin, with the moveables, or with
the solid property of the debtor, transferred to the creditor, in lieu
of the money owing?</p>

<p class='c001'>When a nation can pay with its coin, or with its effects, (that is
to say, with its product and manufactures) the operation is easily
and mechanically performed by the means of trade: when these
objects are not sufficient; or when land, or an annual and perpetual
income out of it, must make up the deficiency; then more
skill and expence is required; and this expence falling upon banks,
makes their trade less lucrative than in times when commerce
stands at par, or is bringing in a balance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were trade to run constantly against a country, the consequence
would be, that the whole property of it would, by degrees, be
transferred to foreigners. This the bank of St. George at Genoa
has operated with regard to Corsica, as has been observed. But in
that case, banks never could neglect laying down a plan whereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>to avoid the loss they casually sustain, when such a revolution
comes suddenly or unexpectedly upon them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method would be, to establish an annual subscription <em>abroad</em>,
for borrowing a sum equivalent to the <em>grand balance</em>; the condition
being to pay the interest of the subscriptions out of the revenue
of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the security offered be good, there is no fear but subscribers
will be found, while there is an ounce of gold and silver in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank of England has an expedient of another nature, in
what they call their <em>circulation</em>; which is a premium granted to
certain persons, upon an obligation to pay a certain sum of coin
upon demand. This is done with a view to answer upon pressing
occasions. But England being a prosperous trading nation, which
seldom has any considerable <em>grand balance</em> against her, (except in
time of war, when the public borrowings supply in a great measure
the deficiency, as shall be afterwards explained) this bank
circulation is turned into a job; the subscriptions being lucrative,
are distributed among the proprietors themselves, who make no
provision for the demand; and were it again to come, (as has
been the case) the subscribers would, as formerly, make a call on
the bank itself, by picking up their notes, and pay their subscriptions
with the bank’s own coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>To obviate this inconvenience, which was severely felt in the
year 1745, the bank of England should have opened a subscription
in some foreign country; Holland, for example; where she might
have procured large quantities of foreign coin: such a seasonable
supply would have proved a real augmentation of the metals; the
supply they got from their own domestic subscribers was only
fictitious<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. At this time there was another circumstance, besides the demand of a balance to
be paid abroad, which distressed the bank, viz. a suspicion which took place, that if
the rebellion had succeeded, the credit of the bank would have totally failed.
This very case points out the great advantage of banks upon mortgage of private
credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said, that the credit of such banks ought to be established upon the principles
of private securities only. If their notes be issued upon solid property, then no
rebellion can influence them: but of this more hereafter.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>But banks in prosperous trading nations sit down with casual
and temporary inconveniencies; and exchangers carry on a profitable
trade, whether the nation be gaining or losing all the while.
For such nations, and such only, are banks advantageous. Were
banks established in Spain, Portugal, or any other country which
pays a constant balance from the produce of their mines, they
would only help on their ruin a little faster.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the infancy of banking, and in countries where the true
principles of the trade are not well understood, we find banks
taking a general alarm, whenever a wrong balance of trade occasions
a run upon them. This terror drives them to expedients for
supporting their credit, which we are now to examine, and which
we shall find to have a quite contrary tendency.</p>

<p class='c001'>The better to explain this combination, we must recall to mind,
that the payment of the <em>grand balance</em> in coin or bills is unavoidable
to banks. We have said that this balance is commonly paid
by exchangers, who pick up the coin in circulation; a thing the
bank cannot prevent. This we have called exhausting a part of
(B): the consequence of this is, to make the proprietors of (C)
come upon the bank, and demand coin for filling up (B): to this
the bank must also agree. But by these operations (C) comes to
be diminished, below the level necessary for carrying on trade, industry,
and alienation: upon which I have said there commonly
comes an application to the bank to give more credit, in order to
support domestic circulation, which if complied with, more solid
property is consequently melted down.</p>

<p class='c001'>This swells the mass of securities, and raises (A) to its former
level. But here the bank has an option to refuse more credit: in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the former operations it had none. Now if the bank, from a terror
of being drained of coin, should refuse to issue notes upon
new credits, for the demands of domestic circulation; in this case,
I say, they fail in their duty to the nation, as banks, and hurt
their own interest. As to their duty to the nation, I shall not insist
upon it; but I think I can demonstrate that they fail in point of
combination, with respect to their own interest, and that is enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>I say, then, that as long as there is one single note in circulation,
and any part of a grand balance owing, that note will come
upon the bank for payment, without a possibility of its avoiding
the demand. Refusing therefore credit, while any notes remain
in the hands of the public, is refusing an interest which may help
to make up the past losses: but of this more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the next place, I think I have demonstrated, that so soon as
the <em>grand balance</em> is paid, it is impossible that any more demands for
coin can come upon the bank for exportation. Why then should
a bank do so signal a prejudice to their country, as to refuse to lend
them paper, which the ready-money demands of the country
must suspend in circulation? And why do this at so great a loss
to themselves? It has been said above, and I think with justice,
that this recruit, issued to fill up circulation, adds to the mass of
bank securities, and very properly represents that part of the income
of the solid property of the country, which the bank must
dispose of to foreigners, in order to procure from them the coin
or bills necessary for answering the demand of payment of a <em>grand
balance</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this light nothing can appear more imprudent, than to refuse
credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>A bank is forced to pay to the last farthing of this balance; by
paying it, the notes that were necessary for circulation are returned
to them; and they refuse to replace them, for fear that
their supplying circulation should create a new balance against
them! This is voluntarily taking on themselves all the loss of
banking, and rejecting the advantages.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Such management can only be prudent when the circulating
notes of a bank are very few, and when the balance is very great.
In that case, indeed, were the thing possible, it might be prudent
to give over banking for a while, till matters took a favourable
turn. But if we suppose their notes to exceed the balance due,
then all the hurt which can be done is done already; and the more
notes are issued, and the more credit is given, so much the better;
because the interest upon all that is issued above the balance,
must be clear profit to the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>To bring what has been said within a narrower compass, and to
lay it under our eye at once, let us call the domestic circulation of
a country, where a bank is established, (A).</p>

<p class='c001'>The specie itself, to carry it on, (B).</p>

<p class='c001'>The balances to other nations, (D).</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank must have a command of credit and coin equal to the
sum of (B) and (D). If they have the value of (D) in any foreign
place, where a general circulation of exchange is carried on; then
they have only occasion for (B) at home, and can furnish bills to
the amount of (D).</p>

<p class='c001'>If (D), in consequence of bills drawn, shall come to be exhausted,
the bank must replace it again, by new contracts, to strangers.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as soon as (D) is paid, either in coin or in bills, then whatever
coin is drawn from the bank, and sent away by private people,
(exchangers, &amp;c.) must form a balance due to the country; which
balance will render exchange favourable, and will occasion a loss
to those who sent away the coin. In this case, the more credit the
bank gives, so much more will their profits increase.</p>

<p class='c001'>To conclude: Let banks never complain of those who demand
coin of them, except in the case when it is demanded in order to
be melted down, or for domestic circulation, which may as well
be carried on with paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so soon as a demand for coin to pay a foreign balance begins,
it is then both the duty and interest of all good citizens to
be as assistant as possible to banks, by contenting themselves with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>paper for their own occasions, and by throwing into the bank all
the coin which casually falls into their hands. As to duty, I shall
offer no argument to enforce it. But I say it becomes a national
concern to assist the bank; because the loss incurred by the bank in
procuring coin, falls ultimately on every individual, by raising exchange;
consequently, prices, by raising the interest of money to
be borrowed; and last of all, by constituting a perpetual interest to
be paid to foreigners, out of the revenue of the solid property of
the country. Upon such occasions, a good citizen ought to blush
at pulling out a purse, when his own interest, and that of his
country, should make him satisfied with a pocket book.</p>

<h4 id='ch4.2.13' class='c015'>CHAP. XIII. <br /> <i>Continuation of the same Subject; and of the Principles upon which Banks ought to borrow Abroad, and give credit at Home.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>In every question relative to this subject, we must return to principles.
This is the only sure method of avoiding error. The
intelligent reader, therefore, must excuse short repetitions, and
consider them as a sacrifice he is making to those of slower capacities,
to whom they are useful.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principle of banking upon mortgage, is to lend and give
credit to those who have property, and a desire to melt it down.
This is calculated for the benefit of trade, and for an encouragement
to industry. If such banks, therefore, borrow, it must be
done consistently with the principles upon which their banking is
founded. If the borrowing should tend to destroy those advantages
which their lending had procured, then the operation is contrary
to principles, and abusive. So much for recapitulation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>While trade flourishes and brings in a balance, banks never have
occasion to borrow; it is then they lend and give credit. This, I
believe, we may take for granted.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the country where the bank is established begins to owe a
balance to other nations, the bank, as we have seen in the last chapter,
is obliged to pay it in coin or in bills. We have there shewn,
that in such cases it is inconsistent with their principles and interest,
to withhold lending and giving credit, so far as is necessary for
keeping up the fund of circulation to that standard which alienation
and ready money demands require.</p>

<p class='c001'>To refuse credit, and at the same time to borrow <em>at home</em>, must
then, at first sight, appear to be doubly inconsistent. But in order
to set this point in the clearest light I am capable, I shall reason
upon a supposition analogous to the situation of the Scotch banks,
and by that means avoid abstraction as much as I can.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me then suppose that Scotland, during the last years of the
war ended in 1763, and ever since (I write in 1764) from the unavoidable
distress of the times, was obliged, 1. to import considerable
quantities of grain in some bad years; 2. to refund the English
loans of money settled there in former times; 3. to furnish some
of the inhabitants with funds, which they thought fit to place in
England; 4. to pay the amount of additional taxes imposed during
the war; while, at the same time, several of the ordinary resources
were withdrawn; such as, 1. a great part of the industrious inhabitants
who went to supply the fleets and armies; 2. the absence
of the ordinary contingent of troops; and 3. the cutting off several
beneficial articles of commerce. Let me suppose, I say, that from
a combination of these losses incurred, and advantages suspended,
Scotland has lost annually, for eight years past, two hundred thousand
pounds. I am no competent judge of the exactness of this
estimate, it is of no consequence to the argument; but I think I
am far beyond the true computation.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, let me suppose, that the sum of currency in
paper, sufficient (with the little coin there was) to circulate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>whole of the alienations in Scotland, (that is to say, the whole
domestic circulation, supposing no balance to be owing to England
or other countries) to be one million sterling. I am persuaded I
am here below the true estimate, but no matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not evident, from this supposition, and from the principles
we have been deducing, that unless the banks of Scotland had
alienated annually in favour of England, a fund for paying the interest
of two hundred thousand pounds capital, and either brought
down the coin, or given bills on London for the sum of that capital
every year; that the million of Scots currency would have been
diminished in proportion to the deficiency; and would not the consequence
of that be, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cæteris paribus</i></span>, to bring the currency below the demand
for it; and, consequently, to hurt trade, industry, and alienation?</p>

<p class='c001'>Now supposing the banks, instead of providing, in England, a
fund equal to this grand balance, (as I have said they should do)
to remain in consternation and inactivity, giving the whole of their
attention to the providing coin and bills to supply the demand of
exchangers, whose business it is to send out this annual balance;
what will the consequence be?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that if the banks, in such a case, do not follow the plan
I have proposed, the consequence will be, that two hundred thousand
pounds of their paper will be, the first year, taken out of the
domestic circulation of Scotland; will be carried to the bank, and
coin demanded for it. If the coin is found in the bank, it is well;
it goes away, and leaves the paper circulation of Scotland at
800,000<i>l</i>. This void must occasion applications to the bank for credits
to supply it. Is it not then the interest of the bank to supply
it? We have said in the former chapters that it is. But now let us
suppose it objected, that if banks should issue notes at such a time,
their cash having been exhausted, they would be obliged to stop altogether,
upon a return of those notes issued upon additional credits.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this I repeat again, because of the importance of the subject,
that notes issued to support the demand of circulation never can
return upon the bank, so as to form a demand for coin; and if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>they do return, it must be in order to extinguish the securities
granted by those who have credit in bank (I except always that
regular demand for coin, at all times necessary for circulating the
paper for domestic uses) and if those notes return of themselves,
without being called in, this phænomenon would be a proof that
circulation is diminishing of itself: but supposing such a case to
happen, it is plain that such return can produce no call for coin;
because when the notes return it is not for coin, but for acquitting
an obligation or mortgage, as has been often repeated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Notes are paid in, I say, because circulation has thrown them
out. Now if circulation has thrown them out as superfluous, it
never can have occasion for coin in their stead; because coin answers
the same purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>But then it is urged that they do not return, because circulation
has thrown them out, but because coin is wanted: be it so. Then
we must say, that circulation is not diminished, as we at first supposed;
but that the return of another year’s balance, makes a new
demand for coin necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now I ask, how the withholding this 200,000<i>l.</i> from circulation,
after the first year’s drain, can prevent the balance from returning?
There are by the supposition still 800,000<i>l.</i> of notes in the country;
will not exchangers get hold of two hundred thousand out of <em>this</em>
fund, as well as out of the million? For he who owes, <em>must pay</em>,
that is, <em>must circulate</em>. It is only the circulation of the industrious,
of the rich, in short <em>buying</em>, that is to say, <em>voluntary circulation</em>, which
is stopped for want of currency: <em>paying</em>, that is, <em>involuntary circulation</em>,
never can be stopped; debtors <em>must</em> find money, as long as there is
any in the country, were they to give an acre for a shilling, or a
house for half a crown. Now those who owe this foreign balance
are debtors; consequently, they must draw 200,000<i>l.</i> out of circulation,
the second year as the first, whether the standard million be
filled up or not. The withholding, therefore, the credits demanded
upon the first diminution, has not the least effect in preventing the
demand for coin the year following: it only distresses the country,
raising exchange, and the interest of money, by rendring money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>scarce; and what is the most absurd of all, it deprives the bank of
10,000<i>l.</i> a year interest, at 5 <i>per cent.</i> upon 200,000<i>l.</i> which it may
issue anew.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose again, that a second year’s demand for a balance of 200,000<i>l.</i>
comes upon the bank: if the coin is out, as we may suppose that after
such a drain it will not be in great plenty, expedients must be fallen
upon. In such a case, if the bank does not at once fairly borrow
at London (without any obligation to repay the capital) a sum of
200,000<i>l.</i> and pay for it a regular interest, according to the rate of
money, with an obligation to pay, as government does, quarterly<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a>,
on the change of London, it will be involved in expedients which
will create a monstrous circulation of coin in the bank, perhaps
double of the sum required, and all those operations will land in the
end (as to the bank) in paying the interest of this sum out of the mass
of its securities or stock. If the bank should borrow this 200,000<i>l.</i>
in London, in the manner we have said, the circulating fund of
coin will be nowise diminished; there will be no call extraordinary,
no rising of exchange; the bank will have <em>this</em> in its hands; and if
it rises, it is the bank, not the exchangers who will profit by it.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Although the interest or dividends on government securities be paid every half
year only, yet by purchasing partly in one fund, and partly in another; for instance,
half in Old South Sea annuities, and half in New, purchasers may have their interest
paid quarterly.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But let us suppose that instead of this, it should have recourse to
temporary credits upon which the capital is constantly demandable,
or to other expedients still less effectual for answering the call which
is to come upon it for the second year’s balance: what will be the
consequence? To this I answer, that those merchants, or others
who owe the balance, will apply to exchangers for bills, for which
they must pay a high exchange: these bills will be <a id='corr182.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='brought'>bought</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_182.26'><ins class='correction' title='brought'>bought</ins></a></span> from
the exchangers with notes, (taken out of circulation) and will reduce
this to 600,000<i>l.</i> the exchangers will carry these to the bank
and demand coin. If the bank should make use of an optional
clause, to pay in six months, with interest at 5 <i>per cent.</i> the exchangers
will obtain six months credit at London, and in consequence
of that, their bills will be honoured and paid. This credit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>costs them money, which is added to the exchange: the bank, at
the end of six months, pays in coin, which in the interval it must
provide from London. It pays also six months interest upon the
paper formerly presented by the exchanger: add to the account,
that bringing down the coin must cost the bank at least 12 shillings
<em>per</em> hundred pounds, and as much more to the exchanger who receives
it in order to send it back again; and after all these intricate
operations which have cost so much trouble, ill blood, stagnation
and diminution of circulation, expence in exchange to the debtors
of the balance, stress of credit upon exchangers for procuring so
large advances with commission, &amp;c. expence to the bank in providing
coin, expence to the exchangers in returning it; after all,
I say, the operation lands in this: that 200,000<i>l.</i> of notes, taken
out of the circulation of Scotland, returns to the bank who must
have provided, at last, either coin, or credit at London for them.
This return of 200,000<i>l.</i> of notes does not diminish the mass of
those obligations lodged in the bank, in virtue of which they are creditors
upon the proprietors of Scotland: consequently, the bank has
constituted itself debtor to England for those funds which have been
<em>torn from it</em> in the manner above described: consequently, had it, by
a permanent loan, constituted itself voluntarily debtor to England
from the beginning, it would have paid no more, nay less than it
has been obliged to pay; circulation would not have lost 200,000<i>l.</i>
and the bank would have had the interest of 200,000<i>l.</i> added to its
former securities, which would compensate (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro tanto</i></span> at least) the
expence of borrowing that sum in England upon a permanent fund.
Instead of which it compensates the interest of a temporary loan,
with the same sum of interest taken out of the securities in its
hand. If, therefore, from an ill grounded fear of issuing as much
paper as is demanded, it shall withhold it, there results to itself a
loss equal to the interest of what it refuses to lend; that is to say,
there is a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lucrum cessans</i></span> to the bank of the interest of this 200,000<i>l.</i>
at 5 <i>per cent.</i> or at 10,000<i>l.</i> a year; which other banking companies
will fill up, and thereby extend their circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>If, besides refusing credits, it should call in any part of those
already given, it still diminishes circulation: but then by that operation
it diminishes the mass of its securities, and so diminishes
the sum of the interest annually paid to itself. If it goes farther and
borrows money at home, such loans will be made in its own paper,
which will diminish farther the mass of circulation; and if it goes
on recalling the credits and mortgages, it will soon draw every bit of
its paper out of circulation, and remain creditor upon Scotland only
for the balance it has paid to England on her account. Such are
the consequences, when a bank which lends upon private security
withholds credit, at a time when a national balance is due, and
when applications are made to it for new credits, to fill up the void
of circulation occasioned by the operations used for the payment of
the balance: such also are the additional fatal consequences, when
to this it adds so inconsistent an operation as that of borrowing in
its own notes, or recalling the credits it had formerly given.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the first step it only appears passive in allowing natural causes
to destroy both the bank and the nation, as I think has been proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the second, it is active in destroying both itself and the
country.</p>

<p class='c001'>What benefit can ever a bank which lends upon private security
reap by borrowing within the country of which it is the center of
circulation; nay, what benefit can it ever reap from withholding
its notes from those who can give good security for them!</p>

<p class='c001'>Every penny it borrows, or calls in, circumscribes its own profits,
while it distresses the country. After all the combinations I have
been able to make, I can discover but one motive which (through
a false light) may engage a bank to this step, to wit, jealousy of
other banks.</p>

<p class='c001'>As this speculation is designed to illustrate the principles of
circulation, from circumstances relative to the present state of the
Scotch banks, let us call things by their names.</p>

<p class='c001'>The banks of Edinburgh resemble, more than any other in Scotland,
a national bank. Let me then suppose all that can be supposed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>viz. that the abundance of their paper has given occasion
to lesser banks to pick up from <em>them</em> every shilling of coin which
these lesser banks have ever had; and that these have had the
address also to throw the whole load of the balance upon those
of Edinburgh: let this be supposed, more cannot, and let us
allow farther, that this must ever continue to be the case. In these
circumstances, what motive can the banks of Edinburgh have for
withholding credit from those who are able to give security? What
motive can they have for borrowing up their own notes?</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed I can account for this plan of management in no other
way than by supposing, that disgusted at the long continuance of
an unfavourable balance of trade against their country, and vexed
to find the whole load of it thrown upon themselves, they have
taken the resolution to abandon the trade, and are taking this method
of recalling their paper altogether.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me suppose the contrary, and I shall not be able to discover
how it is possible that such a conduct can turn to their own advantage,
throwing out all consideration of the public good, which
for some time, no doubt, must be greatly hurt by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>As long as any considerable quantity of their notes is in circulation,
and that the principal exchangers reside at Edinburgh, they
never can avoid the loss of paying the balance; and by refusing
to fill up the void occasioned by the return of their notes, they deliver
the whole profit of replacing them to the other banks, their rivals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me next estimate the losses they sustain by furnishing coin
to the other banks, and for the payment of the balance; and then
compare these with what they lose by not keeping circulation full.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall suppose the balance to cost them two hundred thousand
pounds <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>; and I shall suppose that all the lesser banks put
together have occasion for two hundred thousand pounds in their
chests: Is not this computation far above what can possibly be
supposed?</p>

<p class='c001'>Will it be allowed that if the banks of Edinburgh willingly submit
to pay the whole of the bills of exchange demanded on London,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>for this balance, they will have at least the preference in
replacing that sum to circulation?</p>

<p class='c001'>If they pay the balance of 200,000<i>l.</i> a like sum of their notes
must come in to them, without diminishing one shilling of the
interest paid upon the securities lodged in their banks; consequently,
the only loss incurred is the difference between the interest
they receive, which is 5 <i>per cent.</i> and what it would cost them to
borrow a like sum in London, and to remit the interest of that
sum four times a year.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the value of a 4 <i>per cent.</i> is at present about 96; so in paying
20<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> quarter on the change of London, the Edinburgh banks may
have at London a capital of 96<i>l.</i> Let me call it only 94<i>l.</i> supposing
their credit not to be quite so good as that of the funds.
I think it as good to the full; and I am sure it is so. At this rate,
the 200,000<i>l.</i> will cost them an interest of 8510<i>l.</i> instead of the
10,000<i>l.</i> which they will receive for the like sum added to their former
securities. Now I suppose that they have recourse to exchangers
to remit this interest, and that they pay for it 5 <i>per cent.</i> (which is
an absurd supposition, as they will have the exchange entirely in
their own hands) and that they give all the bills for the 200,000<i>l.</i>
at par, (also a ridiculous supposition) the 5 <i>per cent.</i> on 8510<i>l.</i> is
425<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> which added to the interest, makes 8935<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> so that
after all, they will have upon the whole transaction 1064<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
of profit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next, as to the loss incurred in furnishing 200,000<i>l.</i> to the other
banks: If this coin be demanded of them by those banks, the demanders
must, for this purpose, draw 200,000<i>l.</i> of Edinburgh
notes out of the circulation of Scotland; which I have supposed
may be replaced in some little time by the Edinburgh-banks; consequently,
if this sum also be borrowed at London, there will result
upon this operation, as well as upon the last, a profit of 1064<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
But then indeed they must be at the expence of bringing down the
coin borrowed, at 12<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> 100<i>l.</i> because those banks will insist
upon having coin, and refuse bills on London. This will cost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>1200<i>l.</i> from which deduct the profit of 1064<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> gained by
the first operation, remains of loss upon this last transaction 135<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i> no great sum<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a>. Does it not follow from this reasoning, that
the banks of Edinburgh will have the whole business of exchange
in their own hands? What exchanger then will enter into competition
with them? The domestic transactions with the merchants
and manufacturers of Scotland will be their only business. Farther,</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. We are not to suppose that this yearly balance of 200,000<i>l.</i> is always to continue.
We have seen how it has been occasioned by a course of unfavourable circumstances,
which have run Scotland in debt; we have seen how the banks may interpose
their credit, in order to assist the country in paying it; and we shall see, before we dismiss
this subject, how they will be enabled to repay it, and set Scotland free, by a return
of a favourable balance upon their commerce. Let it then be remembred, that
all those contractions in England are properly the debts of Scotland, not of the banks.
Scotland, therefore, and not the banks, must be at all the expence thereby incurred.
These points shall be explained as we go along.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What prevents the banks of Edinburgh to have offices in every
trading town in Scotland, where their notes may be regularly
paid on presentation, and new credits given as circulation demands
them?</p>

<p class='c001'>The only objection I can find to this plan of banking, is the difficulty
of finding credit at London to borrow such large sums.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, I think, may also be removed, from the plain principles
of credit. If the banks of Edinburgh enter into a fair coalition,
as they ought to do, I think, in order to form really a national
bank, totally independent of that of England; may they not open
a subscription at London, and establish a regular fund of their
own, as well as any other company, such as the India, or South
Sea? By borrowing in the beginning at a small advance of interest
above the funds, and paying as regularly as government does, will
not all those who make a trade of buying and selling stock fill
their loan, rather than invest it in any other carrying a less interest?
And if the whole land securities, and stocks of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>banks at Edinburgh be pledged for this loan, will it not stand on
as good a bottom as any fund upon earth? And can it be doubted
but parliament will encourage such a scheme, upon laying the affairs
of Scotland and the banks properly before them?</p>

<p class='c001'>By this means they will really become a national bank: because
England seems at present to be to Scotland, what all the rest of the
world is to England. Now, the bank of England has no such fund
of credit on the continent, that I know; and were that country to
fall into as great distress, by a heavy balance, as Scotland has been,
she would find as many difficulties in extricating herself by domestic
borrowings, bank circulation, &amp;c. as Scotland has found by
the like domestic expedients. She would then be obliged, for her relief,
to have recourse to a fund opened in Holland, Spain, or Portugal,
like to what I propose for Scotland with respect to England.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have heard it alledged, that the whole distress occasioned to the
banks and circulation of Scotland, was occasioned by a false step
taken by them, some years ago; at the time when the lowness of
the English funds, and a prospect of a peace, occasioned great remittances
from Scotland, and a withdrawing of the large capital
of, perhaps, 500,000 <i>l.</i> owing in Scotland to English persons of
property.</p>

<p class='c001'>At that time, it is said, the banks imprudently launched out in
giving extensive credits to the debtors of those capitals, and to
those who wanted to remit the funds they had secured in the hands of
people who could not pay them; that this threw a load of paper
into circulation, which it could not suspend, being far beyond the
extent of it; and that, consequently, the paper came back upon the
bank, produced a run for coin, which soon exhausted, in a manner,
all that was in Scotland; and that the country has never been able
to recover itself since.</p>

<p class='c001'>This representation is plausible, and has an air of being founded
on principles: in order therefore to serve as a further illustration
of the subject of circulation, I shall point out where the fallacy
lies.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>It is said the banks did wrong in giving those credits. I say, they
did right; but they did wrong in not providing against the consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had they refused the credits, the English and other creditors
would have fallen directly upon their debtors, and obliged them
to pay, by a sale of their lands, at an under value; which, I
think, would have been an infinite loss to Scotland. In this way
the price would have been paid in bank paper, taken out of circulation;
for we have said, that <em>he who owes must pay</em>, be the consequence
what it will. This paper would have come upon the banks
at any rate; and being a balance due to strangers, must have been
paid by the banks. The banks therefore did right to supply the
credits demanded; but then they might have foreseen that the
whole load of paying those debts would fall upon them; which
they being in no capacity to do, should have immediately pledged
in England, the interest of the credits they had given out, after
supplying the want of Scots circulation, and when the notes came
in, they would have had at London the capital of that interest
prepared for paying them off, and no inconvenience would have
been found.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only thing then the bank seem to have misjudged, was the
granting those credits too hastily, and to people who perhaps
would not have invested their funds in England, had it not been
from their facility in giving credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Banks therefore should well examine the state of circulation, and
of the grand balance, in difficult times, before they give credit.
If circulation be full, they may, with justice, suspect that the
credits are demanded with a view of expediency, to transport property
out of the country, which otherwise might have remained.
But in favour of circulation, or in favour of what might be exacted
by foreign creditors, banks never can misjudge in giving credit;
because, if they should refuse to do it, they in the first place incur
a loss themselves; and in the second place, they diminish the fund
of circulation, and thereby hurt the country. Now when, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>such times, a credit is asked or given, that demand is a warning
to banks to prepare; and by preparing they are ready, and no loss
is incurred.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the whole, it is an unspeakable advantage to a nation to
have her foreign debts paid by her bank, rather than to remain
exposed to the demands of private foreign creditors; because,
when a bank pays them, I suppose her to do it upon a loan in the
funding way, where the capital is not demandable by the creditor;
whereas when private citizens are debtors to strangers, the capitals
are always demandable; and when a call comes suddenly and
unexpectedly, the country is distressed. What would become of
Great Britain, if all her debts to strangers were demandable at any
time? It is the individuals who owe, in effect, all that is due to
foreigners; because they pay the interest: but they pay this interest
to the public; and the public appears as the debtor to all
strangers, who have no right to exact the capital, although the
state may set itself free whenever it is convenient.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said above, that after all the combinations I had been able
to form, I could discover but one motive to induce a bank to withhold
credit at a time when it was demanded for the use of domestic
circulation, viz. jealousy of other banks. What my combinations
could not then discover, my inquiries have since unfolded.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is said, that the banks finding so great a propensity in the inhabitants
of Scotland to consume foreign manufactures and produce,
fell upon this expediency of calling in the old, and of refusing
new credits, in order to cut off such branches of hurtful luxury
and expence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could the execution of such a plan prove a remedy against the
vice complained of, this circumstance alone would more clearly
demonstrate the utility of banks upon mortgage, than all I have
been able to say in favour of that establishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us therefore have recourse to our principles, in order to discover
what influence a bank can have in this particular.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>We have distinguished between <em>necessary</em> and <em>voluntary</em> circulation:
the <em>necessary</em> has the <em>payment of debts</em>; the <em>voluntary</em> has buying for its
object.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said that he who owes is either a bankrupt, or <em>must pay</em>,
as long as there is a shilling in the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he who buys, or inclines to buy, <em>must have money</em>, or he can
buy nothing; for if he buys on credit, he then falls immediately
into the former category, and <em>must pay</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>By withholding money for the uses of circulation, which banks
may do for some time, buying <em>may</em> be stopped; paying <em>never can</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now if the mass of money in circulation is brought so low, that
the <em>higher</em> classes of the people, who consume foreign productions,
cannot find money to buy with, what are we to suppose
will be the case with manufacturers, and with the merchants who
buy up <em>their</em> work? Could this operation of the bank affect the
<em>higher classes</em> only, by curbing their anti-patriot expences, without
affecting the <em>lower classes</em>, by curbing their industry, I should think
it an admirable discovery. If it even could be made to affect those
merchants and shop-keepers only, who deal in foreign commodities,
so as to discourage them from carrying on that business, there
would result from it a notable advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>But alas! wherein are they hurt? They trade in such commodities,
not because they are bad citizens, but because they are freemen,
and seek profit wherever the laws permit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps, they find more difficulty than other people in forcing
coin from the bank, as matters stand: perhaps, they are loaded with
opprobrious appellations for extorting such payments from the
bank: perhaps, their credits with the bank are recalled. But must
not those who buy from them, pay them? And must not the bank
give coin, or bills, for the notes they receive, when presented for
payment? Why, therefore, throw difficulties in the way? All the
world knows, that no human engine can prevent a merchant from
laying all the expences of his trade upon the consumer. Correct
the taste of the consumers, and you may stop the trade: no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>other restraint will be of any consequence. But in order to correct
the taste of consumers, do not deprive them absolutely of money;
because the money the landlord receives, comes from the farmer,
for the price of his grain, &amp;c. Would it be a good scheme for
preventing soldiers from drinking brandy, to cut off their subsistence-money?
Give a drunkard but a penny a day, it will go
for liquor; and those who are fond of foreign clothing, will take
the price of it from their bellies, to put it on their backs.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this scheme of the bank’s withholding credit, proves, at present,
any check to those dealers in English goods, it will be but
for a very short time. They have been taken by surprize; and,
perhaps, thrown into inconveniencies from an unexpected change
of bank management; but as long as there is a demand for such
commodities, there will be a supply; and when people owe, they
<em>must pay</em>. No operation of a bank can prevent this.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must, therefore, according to principles, disapprove of this
public-spirited attempt in the banks of Edinburgh; because, if it
should succeed, it will have the effect of ruining all the trade and
industry of Scotland, in order to prevent the sale of English goods:
and if it does not succeed, which is more than probable, from the
assiduity of other banks in supplying credit, it will have the effect
of ruining the banks of Edinburgh themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>This step, of calling in the bank credits, and opening a subscription
for a loan, is represented by others in a light somewhat different.</p>

<p class='c001'>By these it is alledged, that in the beginning of the year 1762,
when the Edinburgh banks withdrew ¼ of all their cash accompts,
and opened a subscription for borrowing-in their own notes, at an
interest of 4, and even 5 <i>per cent.</i> the demand for money, to send
to England, was not occasioned by the great balance owing by Scotland,
but to the high premium money then bore at London; because,
says the author of a letter to J... F...... Esq; published
at that time,</p>

<p class='c001'>“This demand arises from a profit on carrying money to London,
<em>as a commodity</em>, and not as a balance of trade.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>It is not easy to comprehend how there could be much profit
in carrying money to London at 3 <i>per cent.</i> loss by exchange, from
Scotland, where it bore 5 <i>per cent.</i> interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true, that at certain times, there were considerable profits
made upon stock-jobbing; by which some won, and others were
ruined. I agree, that the country was greatly hurt by the folly
of those who played away their own property, and by the roguery
of others, who borrowed that of their neighbours, with an intention
of gaming at their risk. But is this a vice which any bank can
correct, while it has a note in circulation?</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, it was a sentiment of patriotism which moved the
banks to such a plan of conduct, I say they thereby did more hurt
to industry, by contracting circulation, than good to Scotland, by
attempting a thing which was beyond their power to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c001'>If they were moved to it by a principle of self preservation, I say
they lost their aim, by cutting off their own profits, which would
have done much more than indemnify them for the loss of borrowing
at London, at the time when money there was hardest to be
got: for whatever exorbitant expence of exchange gamesters may
incur, to procure ready money to play with, the rate of the
stocks at that time never was so low, as to afford a profit upon money
remitted at 3 <i>per cent.</i> loss by exchange, while that money was
bearing 5 <i>per cent.</i> interest at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lowest rate of stocks was in January 1762. Towards the end
of that month 3 <i>per cents.</i> fell to 63¼: this makes the value of money
to be about 4<i>l</i>. 12<i>s.</i> <i>per cent.</i> In these funds, certainly, no
body could invest, with profit, money sent from Scotland.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the new subscription had been open for some time, scrip
indeed, or 4 <i>per cent.</i> fell in this month so low as 74½, that is, money
rose to 5.4 <i>per cent.</i> whereas had scrip stood at the proportion of
the 3 <i>per cents.</i> it should have been worth about 84: but at the beginning
of a war with Spain, when the minds of men were depressed,
and filled with apprehensions, and when a new loan was
perhaps expected at a higher interest than ever government had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>given, was it natural for people to be fond of investing in a 4 <i>per
cent.</i> stock, which was to fall to 3 <i>per cent.</i> in a few years?</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, let us examine the profit to be made by investing even in
that fund. 100<i>l.</i> produced in Scotland 5<i>l.</i> interest, that capital
remitted to London at 3 <i>per cent.</i> exchange, was reduced to 97<i>l.</i>: now
if 74.5<i>l.</i> produced 4<i>l.</i> the produce of 97<i>l.</i> would be about 5<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i>
Would any man for the sake of ⅕ <i>per cent.</i> advance of interest on
money remitted, ever think of sending large sums to London to be
invested in a falling stock?</p>

<p class='c001'>I allow that, upon opening subscriptions, great profit was sometimes
made by those who contracted with government, and who
received the subscriptions at prime cost. But this profit depended
entirely upon the subsequent rise of the subscription, when the
original subscribers brought it first to market; as also from the
small sums they had advanced: this operation was over before the
end of January 1762. The smalness of the sum advanced, upon
which the profit was made, and the ministerial interest which was
necessary to obtain a share in those subscriptions, rendred it extremely
difficult for people in Scotland to share in the profit by remitting
large sums in the proper point of time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther, might not the banks, in the short period during which
such large profits were made, had they had the exchange in their
hands, have raised it so high as to frustrate the attempts of our Scots
gamesters? If it be said, that exchangers would have disappointed
them, by giving it lower; I answer in the negative: because to that
set of men exchange will rise, of itself, in proportion to the value of
money <em>in the place to which people incline to remit it</em>. And could money at
any time bring in, at London, 20 <i>per cent.</i> interest, exchange upon
that place would rise universally in proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only motive, not already mentioned, for sending money to
London at this time, under so great disadvantages, was the prospect of
a great rise upon the stocks, in the event of a peace. Upon which I
observe, that the value of that probability was included in the then
price of stock; and had the probability of a peace, in January 1762,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>been great, stocks would have risen in proportion: he, therefore, who
vested his money in stock, by remitting from Scotland at that time,
upon an expectation peculiar to himself, I consider as a gamester,
and as an ignorant gamester too; because he was giving odds upon
an equal bett. This every man does, who, without any prospect
of a profit peculiar to himself, pays a high exchange to bring money
to a market, where he buys at the same price with those who
pay no exchange at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these considerations, I am led to differ from the ingenious
author of the letter to J. F. Esq; who says, “That in the present
case” (the circumstances operating in January 1762,) “the demand”
(for money to remit to London) “is unlimited, and no
provision the banks can make can be of use; on the contrary,
could they find a treasure, suppose of a million, it would only
serve to increase it; because this demand arises on a profit on carrying
money to London as a commodity, and not as the balance
of trade.”</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.14' class='c015'>CHAP. XIV. <br /> <i>Of optional Clauses contained in Bank Notes.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>As we are examining the principles upon which banks of circulation
upon mortgage, which issue notes payable in coin,
are established in Scotland, it is proper to take notice of every circumstance
which may arise from the extensive combination of the
interests of trade and circulation, especially when we find such circumstances
influencing the political welfare of society.</p>

<p class='c001'>An optional clause in a bank note is added to prevent a sudden
run upon banks, at a time when more coin may be demanded of
them than they are in a capacity to pay.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Banks not regulated by statute, are private conventions, in
which the parties may include what conditions they think fit.
Banks, therefore, may insert in their notes, the conditions they
judge most for their own advantage. Thus, they may either promise
peremptory payment in coin upon demand, or they may put
in an alternative, that in case they do not choose to pay in coin, they
may pay in bills, or in transfer of their stock, or in other circulating
paper not their own; or they may stipulate a certain space of time
after the demand, with interest during the delay. All these alternatives
are inserted, in order to avoid the inconvenience of running
short of coin, and of being obliged to stop payment altogether.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said above, that the profits of banks consist in their enjoying
the same interest for the notes they lend, as if the loan had
been made in gold or silver. This is a very great object, no doubt;
but the policy of nations has established it, and therefore we shall
suppose it to be an uncontroverted principle.</p>

<p class='c001'>In which ever way, therefore, an optional clause is inserted, it
should be such as to cut off all profit from the bank, upon all paper
presented for payment, from the time of presentation; and every
artifice used to suspend the liquidation of the paper, to the advantage
of the bank, and prejudice of the bearer, should be considered
as unfair dealing in the bank, and prohibited by law.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the optional clause has no tendency to procure advantage
to the bank, in prejudice of the holder of the paper (except so far
as the holder is thereby deprived of the use of coin, which on certain
occasions cannot be supplied by the paper) it becomes the duty
of a statesman to examine how far it is expedient to suffer such
stipulations to be inserted, in a money which is calculated to carry
on the mercantile interest of the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Banks, we have said, are the servants of the public, and they are
well paid for their services. Although the notes issued by them
are not commonly made a legal tender in payment; yet the consequence
of a well established bank, is to render them so essential to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>circulation, that what is not a legal obligation becomes one, <em>in fact</em>,
from the force of custom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us therefore examine the advantages which result to banks
from this optional clause, and the loss which results to a nation
from their use of it, and then compare the advantages with the inconveniencies,
in order to determine whether or not it is expedient
to permit such obstructions in the circulation of paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>The advantages which banks reap is confined to that of gaining
time, at the expence of paying interest. The interest paid by them is
an aukward operation. They receive interest for the note; because
they have in their possession the original security given for the notes
when they were first issued; and they begin to refund this interest
to the holder of the note from the time they make use of the optional
clause. Could the banks, therefore, borrow coin in a moment, and
pay <a id='corr197.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='no'>the same</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_197.15'><ins class='correction' title='no'>the same</ins></a></span> interest for the coin which they pay to the holder of the
note, they would certainly never make use of this optional clause.
But this coin is not to be found in a moment; and the banks, to
save themselves the trouble, and the expence of augmenting the
fund of coin, or of procuring a fund out of another country, upon
which they might draw for the payment of that national balance,
which, by becoming banks, they tacitly engage to pay for the nation,
render the credit of individuals precarious with strangers, and
raise a general distrust of the whole society which they ought to serve.
Here then is a very great loss resulting to a nation from the establishment
of banks. Were no bank established, no merchant would
contract a debt to strangers, without foreseeing the ready means of
discharging it with the coin circulating in the country. In proportion
as this coin came to diminish, so would foreign contractions
of debt diminish also. Thus <em>credit</em>, at least, might be kept up,
although trade might be circumscribed, and manufactures be discouraged.
Now when, in order to advance trade and encourage
manufactures, a statesman lends his hand towards the melting
down of solid property, and countenances banks so far as to leave
that operation to them, with the emolument of receiving interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>for all their paper; and when, in order to facilitate the circulation
of this paper, the very inhabitants concur in throwing all their
specie into a bank, is it reasonable to indulge banks so far as to
allow them to add an optional clause, which disappoints the whole
scheme, which stops trade, ruins manufactures, raises the interest
of money, and renders the operation of melting down property
quite ineffectual for the purposes which it was intended to answer?
Farther,</p>

<p class='c001'>The loss a bank may be at, in providing coin, is susceptible of
estimation, let it be brought from ever so distant a country; because
we know that the quantity to be provided, never can exceed the
value of the <em>grand balance</em>. But who can estimate the loss a nation
sustains, when an interruption is put to carrying on trade and manufactures?
When the industrious classes of inhabitants are forced
to be idle for a short time, the consequences are hardly to be repaired:
they starve, they desert; the spirit of industry is extinguished;
in short, all goes to ruin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, when banks do not lay down a well digested plan for
paying regularly, and without complaining, this <em>grand balance</em> due
to strangers, they are forced to have recourse to expedients for preserving
their credit, more burdensome, perhaps, than what is required
of them; and not near so effectual for removing the inconveniences
complained of.</p>

<p class='c001'>The expedients they fall upon to obtain credit, coin, and bills,
are so various, and so complicated, that they alone are able to explain
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes we see them entring into contracts with private merchants
and exchangers, (<em>living among themselves!</em>) who engage for
a certain premium to furnish coin as it is demanded. The consequence
of this, is, to expose the bank to a new demand for coin,
from the very contractors, in order to fulfil their engagements; an
abuse we have taken notice of above in speaking of the <em>bank circulation</em>
of England.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Let us suppose that these undertakers for coin do really set out
by doing <em>in part</em> what banks should <em>effectually</em> do themselves, that is,
by bringing from another nation, the coin which they are to supply.
What is the consequence? The banks pay the undertaker for this
coin in their own notes. Did they only engage to pay a certain
interest for the coin so provided, then the end would be accomplished,
with the additional expence to them of paying the undertaker
for his expence, trouble, and profit. But if they, instead of
paying interest for the coin so furnished, shall issue their notes for
the full value of it, such notes can never enter into domestic circulation,
so as to be suspended in it as it were; because it is not domestic
circulation which has demanded them: they must then
return upon the bank, either from the very hand who received
them, or at least, after a short circulation; and thus draw out again
the whole coin furnished by the undertaker. This produces a prodigious
circulation of coin, and induces people to imagine that
either the <em>grand balance</em> is inexhaustible, or that the premium upon
money at London is very high, or that people can contrive a fictitious
balance, as a means of profiting upon coin, after the balance
has been actually paid<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. The directors of the bank of England have had recourse to a like expedient with
as little success. They used, during the war, to buy up, with their paper, the coin
brought in by privateers; and after they had been at this trouble, the notes they had
given for it returned upon them, and drew it out again.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This method of providing coin is absolutely delusive, and opens
a door to infinite abuse. Those who furnish the coin to the bank,
are either in the combination against the bank, and draw it out as
fast as they throw it in; or they are not in the combination: if they
are in the combination, they profit by it; if they are not, they are
hurt by their contract, and other exchangers draw the advantage;
but the bank is equally a loser in both cases.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me suppose that they are not in the combination, and that
they honestly procure the coin at their own expence. If they are
paid in notes for the coin they furnish, we must suppose that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>coin they have procured, is not in consequence of a loan, but of a
<em>credit</em> given them in the place from which the coin is sent: for I
never can suppose that any merchant will borrow coin upon a <em>loan</em>,
and lie out of so large a capital while he has bank notes in his
hand to pay up what he has received. If he has procured this coin
upon <em>credit</em>, will not this, when it comes to be replaced, augment
the grand balance against the nation in favour of the country or
city which granted that credit? And must not that balance be paid
by exchangers out of the coin received by the bank? If, therefore,
we suppose that the undertaker does not draw out the very coin he
had just delivered into the bank, will not exchangers do it for him;
will not they be ready with notes, as soon as the coin is lodged in
the bank, to draw it out, and send it off, in order to furnish the undertaker
with bills to fill up his credit, for the coin he had received
from people residing in the place to which the exchangers have
sent coin, to be ready to answer their draughts? Does this differ in
the least from what is called drawing and redrawing, which is sufficient
to ruin any man, and must not a like practice ruin a bank,
by raising exchange to a monstrous height?</p>

<p class='c001'>This being the case, the shortest and the best method of preventing
such abuses, is to oblige banks to pay upon demand, in coin or
bills, at the option of the holder of the note. This will force them
into the method of providing them; to wit, fairly borrowing money
from nations to whom we owe, and paying a regular interest for it,
without an obligation to refund the capital, until the grand balance
shall take a favourable turn; in which case, the banks will regorge
with coin drawn from strangers, and these strangers will then find
as great an interest in being repaid, as the bank found in borrowing
from <em>them</em>, while the balance was in <em>their</em> favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said, that a statesman should oblige all public banks to
pay regularly upon demand, in coin or bills, at the option of the
holder of the note. But then he must facilitate to them the means
which he has in his power, of providing themselves with the coin,
or bills demanded.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>For that purpose, he must, first, provide them with a mint, for
how, without a mint, can a bank convert into coin the metals it
may provide from other countries? Next, he must put that mint
under such regulations as to cut off all profit from money-jobbers,
who will be ready to draw coin out of the bank the moment they
find the least advantage in tampering with it. In order to prevent
this abuse, a reasonable rate of coinage should be imposed, according
to the principles laid down in the third book; and when banks
have occasion to pay a balance out of the nation’s coin, a drawback
for part of the coinage should be given them. This drawback will
support the value of the coin, and the loss of the remainder will
engage them to export bullion preferably to coin, when it is to be
found: and if no drawback were given, the coinage would be
totally lost to the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>When this deduction is given, the coin must be melted down,
and stamped in bars at the mint; both in order to prevent frauds
in the drawbacks, and to disappoint strangers who receive it at the
price of bullion, from gaining the price of coinage when they return
it back. And in the last place, all light coin should be banished out
of circulation, and made to pass by weight for bullion, at the current
price of the market. All banks should both receive and deliver
coin by weight, when the sums are so considerable as to require
full bags of coin to pay them. It is not here necessary to repeat
what has been said upon this subject at so much length in another
place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method of facilitating to banks the means of providing bills
for the payment of foreign balances, is, secondly, to assist them in procuring
loans beyond the district of their own circulation. If government
shall be satisfied that the intention of demanding such loans,
is to enable the bank to interpose their credit in favour of the trade
and industry of those who circulate their paper, and who have no
way of paying such balances, but with their solid property; in that
case, government will, undoubtedly, assist the bank in obtaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>loans for so national a purpose, by declaring the security upon
which they desire the loan to be good, and by becoming answerable
to the public for the solidity of it.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.15' class='c015'>CHAP. XV. <br /> <i>Of subaltern Banks of Circulation, and of their Competition with one another.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We have hitherto treated of the principles which influence
national banks of circulation, we now come to examine
some peculiarities attending banks of a subaltern nature, which
for the most part trust to the national bank for all supplies of coin;
and when this resource fails them, they are thereby involved
in difficulties which are not easily got the better of. Besides this
inconvenience, to which all subaltern banks are subject, they are
frequently exposed to competition with one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>A national bank enjoys such great advantages from the stability of
its credit, and the regularity of its operations, that it is not easy
for any other private company to establish themselves upon the same
solid system.</p>

<p class='c001'>When any banking company is established, which draws its support
from a national bank, the facility of carrying on the business
by so great an assistance, naturally engages other companies to imitate
their example. From thence arises a competition. All such
banks begin to consider the circulation of their own district as their
undoubted property, and they look with an eye of jealousy upon
every note which does not carry their own mark.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great point of their ambition is to gain credit with the national
bank; and could they obtain of that company to receive their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>notes, or to give them credit for their draughts, in cases of necessity,
they would be at their ease; because the national bank would then
be at the whole expence of providing coin and bills, and they would
have nothing to think of, but to extend the sphere of their own
circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to all these subaltern societies, the national bank
will no doubt steer an equal course. I suppose every one to be
settled upon good security; without which they do not deserve the
name of banks.</p>

<p class='c001'>In proportion to their stocks, and according to the state of the
national balance, they may, as well as any private person, on many
occasions, draw considerable supplies of coin from the national
bank, without lying under any obligation to it; because when exchange
is low, they can realize any part of their stock into coin,
out of the national bank, at very little loss, excepting the interest
of it: for interest must always be reckoned upon every guinea which
lies in their chest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did these banks consider one another in a proper light, they must
see in an instant that the solidity of every one is equally good; because
I now suppose them all standing upon the principles of private,
not mercantile credit, as above explained.</p>

<p class='c001'>What benefit then can they possibly reap from their mutual jealousies,
from gathering up each other’s notes, and coming with a run
upon one another from time to time? The consequences of this
will be, to oblige themselves and others to preserve for <em>domestic circulation</em>
a larger quantity of coin than is necessary, and thereby to
diminish their own profit: to take up their attention in providing
against their own reciprocal attacks, and thereby neglect the providing
a supply for that demand which is indispensable; to wit,
the payment of the grand balance due to other nations; at which
time the resource of the national bank will certainly fail them.
The managers of every one of them will pretend that it is they who
are saddled with this burden; but the nature of the thing speaks
for itself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Wherever this grand balance is transacted, the exchangers residing
in the place will have recourse to the bank there established;
and if there be more than one, that which pays with the greatest
readiness will have the best credit, the most notes in circulation,
and the largest profits upon the whole. If any one is found slow,
or difficult in paying its paper, exchangers will be the more punctual
in making their demand for payment, and they will even be
averse to receiving such notes from their correspondents.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every man who has occasion for credit from a bank, will apply
to that whose notes are the most esteemed. In short, there will be
profit, in the main, to the bank which pays the best, although I
allow that at particular times there may be some additional inconveniences,
unless a regular plan be laid down on the principles
above deduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>This however is a vague reasoning; because the matter of fact
is not known. All that can be said with certainty, is, that while
no public regulation is made with regard to banking, every one
will carry on the trade according to his views of profit; and private
animosities between different companies, will only tend to distress
the nation and themselves, as experience has, I believe, discovered.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, as matters stand, a very great inconvenience results to Scotland
from the want of a communication of paper credit with England,
and if thereby an exchange of 4 and even 5 <i>per cent.</i> has been
paid for bills upon London, because all the coin of the country is
locked up in banks; I ask what would be the consequence, if banks
had their will in banishing from the circulation of their own district,
every other notes but their own? In that case, we might, in a
short time, find an exchange of 4 and 5 <i>per cent.</i> between Fife and
Lothian, between Glasgow and Ayr, and so of the rest. What would
then become of manufacturers, who could not dispose of their work at
the distance of a few miles, without having recourse to exchangers
for their payment? If such an abuse were once allowed to creep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>in, there would be no other remedy but to destroy banks altogether,
and throw the little coin there is into circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, when banks are in a good understanding,
when they are established on solid principles, when their paper is
issued on proper security, the public is safe; and in every little district,
under the wings of their own bank, there will arise a set of
exchangers, who will give credit to merchants and manufacturers,
and who will have recourse to their own bank for the coin or bills
necessary for their occasions. This will naturally divide the payment
of the grand balance among them, in a due proportion to
their circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now consider the principles which may direct a statesman
to settle banking upon mortgage on a proper footing, to serve every
national purpose.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.16' class='c015'>CHAP. XVI. <br /> <i>Of some Regulations proper to be made with regard to national Banks.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>From what has been said, we may conclude, that were a
national bank upon mortgage, established on a plan calculated
to answer the purposes of the most extensive domestic circulation,
it might be regulated in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Let a large stock of property, of one species or other, be provided,
in order to gain the confidence of the public, and let it be
pledged for the payment of all the notes.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, Let all solid property intended to be melted down into paper
money, be first constituted in such a manner as to be easily sold,
and in the mean time secured to the company, for their advance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>preferably to every other person, and let it be of a revenue fully
sufficient to acquit the interest for ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The capitals due to the bank must not be demandable by the
bank, as long as the interest is regularly paid.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, Every one who constitutes his property according to the regulations,
must be entitled to a proportional credit from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>5<i>to</i>, All bank securities must be pledged in the hands of government
for the interest of whatever money the bank may borrow with
their consent, beyond the district of their own circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>6<i>to</i>, Government must support the bank in proportion to the extent
of their funds.</p>

<p class='c001'>7<i>to</i>, Let bank notes be payable to bearer, either in coin, or in
inland bills to the value, or in a transfer of a corresponding interest
at — <i>per cent.</i> all in the option of the holders.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were such regulations established, the borrowing from banks
would become very easy; any man who is master of his property,
though incumbred with debts, might put it into bank regulation,
might raise upon it what sum he thought fit, with which all his
debts might be paid off; he might even give credit upon it to those
who otherwise are not in a situation to obtain it: for which credit
given, a profit in the rate of interest might be allowed to him. Were
a plan concerted consistently with the principles which have suggested
this general sketch, all borrowing and lending of money
would soon center in the bank. Securities would be easy, and expence
greatly avoided.</p>

<p class='c001'>A national bank, when rightly constituted, may however be safely
indulged in more extensive methods of circulating their paper than
upon land security. The bank of England is allowed by charter to
issue notes for discounting bills of exchange, it may trade in gold
and silver, may advance money to government upon the security
of taxes imposed and levied within the year. But it is in general
debarred commerce, and every precarious object of traffic. The
reason is plain. The paper it issues becomes the property of the
nation, and may form in a short time the greatest part of the currency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of it. In such a case, were the bank exposed to losses by trade,
or insolvency of debtors for great sums, the whole credit of the nation
might be ruined, and all the lower classes of the manufacturing
inhabitants undone, before such a blow could be repaired.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under proper regulations, bank paper might be made a legal tender
in every payment: in which case it is hardly possible that any
considerable demand for coin should ever be made upon them, except
for the payment of the <em>grand balance</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This national bank may have different offices, in different cities
within the kingdom, and these will make subaltern banks both
useless and unprofitable. It might even be stipulated, that a certain
proportion of bank stock, in the name or for the behoof of any
city, should entitle that city to a proportional part of the administration
within their own district. As these are only speculations, not
plans, I need not set about removing objections, which are constantly
many and well grounded, whenever any new establishment
or innovation is proposed. All I aim at is to set this principle in a
clear light, to wit, that it is the interest of every trading state to
have a sufficient quantity of paper, well secured, to circulate through
it, so as to facilitate payments every where, and to cut off inland
exchanges, which are a great clog upon trade, and are attended
with the risk of receiving the paper of people whose credit is but
doubtful.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this purpose, I have proposed that inland bills should be demandable
from the bank at par, as well as specie.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be an admirable improvement upon this scheme, to
make a like regulation as to foreign bills. However, this speculation
is reserved for another opportunity. All I shall say, at present,
upon that head, is, that as we have seen how the whole national
balance must be paid by banks (who circulate paper payable in coin
on demand, and who consequently must, on some occasions, draw
the metals from abroad for that purpose, in order to fill up the void
made by exchangers, who send them out) and it would, I think, be
shortning, in some measure, that operation, and be a means, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>same time, of indemnifying the bank in this respect, to regulate
matters so, that all foreign exchanges might be transacted there at
fixed rates, according to the place where the exchange is to be made,
without erecting any monopoly for that purpose in favour of the
bank, or depriving any one of the liberty to deal in exchange, who
can afford it at more reasonable terms than the bank; but of this
more when we come to the doctrine of exchange.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.17' class='c015'>CHAP. XVII. <br /> <i>When and in what case Banks should be obliged to keep open Books.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>If no national bank be established under proper regulations, and
entire liberty allowed to every one to take up the trade who can
issue his notes, I think it would be against all principles of good policy
not to oblige such banks to keep open books, to be inspected regularly
by some authority or other; in order to see upon what security that
paper stands, which is the instrument of commerce, a part of every
man’s private property, and which, if any part of it should once fail,
either through the knavery, misconduct, or misfortune, of a particular
company, would cast a general discredit upon all paper, and
be a means of bringing on those calamities which we have so often
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>I know the ordinary objection against this, is, the inconvenience
of throwing open the secrets and mysteries of trade. As to the mysteries
of trade, this point shall be examined in another place.
But here, I say, there is no question of trade in which any risk is
implied: and if any one can suppose, that, at any time, the affairs
of a bank are in so ticklish a situation as not to bear inspection, that
very supposition shews how necessary it is not to permit such a bank
to continue this circulation. The only inspection, in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>public is interested, is to know the quantity of notes issued, and the
extent and nature of the securities pledged for them. They have
no business to examine the state of their cash, or of particular
people’s credit. They may be without a shilling in their coffers,
and still their paper be as good as if they had a million. Such an
inspection, as I propose, would rather confirm than shake their
credit, but it would be a means of preventing them from launching
out into speculations in matters of commerce, which is not their
district; and from gaming with national property.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be said, that this inspection would lay open the affairs of
many private men, debtors to the bank, I answer in the negative; because
no man’s credit is hurt by his having a cash account, and no
inspection is requisite, as to the state of that accompt with the bank.
The credit may be either quite full, or quite exhausted; this particular
interests no body but the parties themselves; but it is essential
to know upon what security the credit has been given; because
every man who has a note of such a bank in his possession, has a
very good title to be informed concerning the security on which it
stands.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not sufficient to say, that the holder of the note, if he doubts
of the security, may demand payment. It is not here the interest
of any individual, but that of the public which is attended to: and
if, according to the principles of common reason, it be just, that a
creditor should have it in his power to watch over the abilities of his
debtor, so as to secure his payment; certainly it is equally just, that
the public (which I consider here as the creditor) should be made
certain, that what is circulating with as great facility as the King’s
coin, contains a real value in it. Would it be a good answer
from any man who held a piece of false money in his hand, for
the use of circulation, to skreen himself, by alleging that if it be
false, no body need to take it. It is the right of every man to detect
false coin; but it is the right of government <em>only</em> to detect false paper:
because law only can authorise such an inquisition. Does not the
charter of the bank of England establish this right in government?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>If the bank be confined to certain particular branches of solid trade,
where little risk is incurred, might not government examine, when
necessary, whether these regulations have been observed; and how
can this be done without such an inspection as is here recommended?</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.18' class='c015'>CHAP. XVIII. <br /> <i>Is it the Interest of Banks to grant Credits and Cash Accompts to Exchangers and others, who make a Trade of sending Coin out of the Country?</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>The answer to this question is very short.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the principles we have deduced, it is plain, that it is
both the office and interest of banks to give credit to all who can
give good security for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cause of doubt upon this question, arises only from certain
inconveniences which have been of late experienced in Scotland;
but which never would have been felt, had banks attended to their
true interest, in providing funds to answer the demands of those
who are either obliged, or who find an interest in paying off what
the nation owes upon the grand balance to foreigners.</p>

<p class='c001'>To set this matter in a clear light, let me suppose that, some time
ago, the banks had at once withdrawn all the credits granted to
exchangers; and opened a subscription for a loan of money, equal
to what they might estimate the sum borrowed by that set of men
within the country, for the sake of carrying on their business.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to principles, these two operations should go hand in
hand: the recalling the credits would, no doubt, have greatly distressed
exchangers; but as long as they could find money to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>borrow from private hands, that inconvenience would have been
lessened. Besides, I apprehend that the late custom among exchangers,
of borrowing at 4 <i>per cent.</i> owes its existence to the difficulty
they felt in obtaining extensive credits from the bank; and
if this be the case, then there has been a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lucrum cessans</i></span> to the
bank of 5 <i>per cent.</i> upon the amount of all these borrowings; because
exchangers, I apprehend, would prefer a credit from the bank
at 5 <i>per cent.</i> to a loan at 4 <i>per cent.</i> payable on demand, according
to the occasions of those who keep their money with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most effectual method, therefore, to hurt exchangers, would
have been to have recalled all their credits, and offered to borrow,
upon the same terms, what was lent to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The execution of such a plan would, I think, have been, 1. diametrically
opposite to the interest of the banks; 2. would have occasioned
such a run upon exchangers, as to throw them into great distress;
and 3. would have ended in the total ruin of the trade of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c001'>That such a plan is diametrically opposite to all principles of
banking, I suppose, is by this time sufficiently understood.</p>

<p class='c001'>That it would have occasioned a run upon exchangers, is pretty
certain: because however good their credit might be, it must be
acknowledged to be inferior to that of the banks; and therefore no
body would prefer them for debtors, to the bank, upon the same
terms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third consequence is as evident, upon a short reflection, as
the other two. The run upon the exchangers would have obliged
them to make a call upon all the merchants and dealers in Scotland,
to whom they gave credit: for which purpose, and for which
alone, they find an interest in borrowing at so high an interest as
4 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The call, then, made by the exchangers upon their debtors, is
neither more or less than a call upon the money employed in the
trade of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now we have said, that whoever owes <em>must pay</em>. The merchants
of Scotland owe to exchangers; the latter are pressed by their creditors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and <em>must pay</em> with what they have, which consists in money
only: when that is exhausted, they must shut up shop. <em>They</em> again
call upon the merchants, who <em>must pay</em> with what they have.
This consists in goods, and in the manufactures of Scotland; and
these they <em>must</em> sell at any price. There may not be time sufficient
to export with advantage. To whom then must they sell? To
people within the country, who have no money to buy with; because
credit is withheld by that body which only can give it. I
conclude with the old saying of the law,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Unum quodque eodem modo solvitur quo colligatum est.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The best method to establish credit in an industrious nation, is a
bank properly regulated: and the best methods to ruin it effectually,
when established, are the inconsistent operations of such a bank.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.19' class='c015'>CHAP. XIX. <br /> <i>Application of the Principles above deduced, towards forming the Policy of Circulation.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>From the principles above deduced, there arise three principal
objects of attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first, the circulation of paper for domestic uses.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second, the method of providing coin for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third, the method of paying foreign balances.</p>

<p class='c001'>These three objects are absolutely different in their nature, and
they are influenced by different principles. The consequence of
blending them together, is to render the subject, which is abundantly
intricate in its own nature, still more dark and perplexed.
What is to follow has no relation to any plan proposed for execution;
it is only intended as a farther illustration of the general principles
which influence this branch of my subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, As to the circulation of paper for domestic use.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>It has been said, that the great utility of banks of circulation
upon mortgage, was to facilitate the melting down of solid property;
in order to enable every one who has property, to circulate
<em>the capital</em> of it for the advancement of industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this purpose he comes to a bank, pledges the capital he wants
to melt down, and receives for his obligation, bearing interest, paper
money which bears none.</p>

<p class='c001'>This paper money, I suppose to be as solidly secured as the principles
of private credit can make it. I suppose the bank to be established
by authority, according to the regulations already mentioned,
and the notes made a legal tender in every payment of
<em>domestic debts</em>; by which I understand <em>debts</em> payable within the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these data, I say, that the regular method by which the bank
should acquit the obligation in the notes, is by restoring the security
granted at issuing the notes, if they be returned by the debtor
in it; or by a transfer of a sum of interest equivalent to the notes,
if they are presented by any other. All farther obligations laid
upon banks to pay in coin, or inland bills, is only an equivalent
expected from them in lieu of their great profits<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. It must here be observed, that in every country where there is a national coin established,
it is absolutely necessary to connect with it the denominations of the paper;
in order to affix a determinate value to these denominations. This may easily be done
without implying, as at present, an obligation on the bank to realize into coin every
bit of paper in circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>interest</em>, therefore, of the credits given by the bank, may be demandable from
the debtors in coin; and the transfers of interest made by the bank, to those who bring
in notes for payment, may also be demandable in coin from the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>These payments will bear a small proportion to the paper in circulation, as interest
must be very low; and coming at fixed terms of payment, provision will easily be made
for them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This regulation will support the coin of the country, and as the <em>interest</em> of all the
paper becomes demandable in coin, the intrinsic value of the <em>interest</em> will effectually support
the value of the <em>capital</em>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When paper issued for domestic circulation returns to a bank,
were it not for the profits on their trade, I see no reason why a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>bank should pay in any other species of property than what it
received; and if, by the interest they receive for their notes, they
are abundantly indemnified for all the difference between paying
in coin and in transfer, I think the public would be a gainer to dispense
with that obligation in lieu of an abatement of interest; which
would be an advantage to commerce, not to be counterbalanced by
the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther, the business of providing coin is totally different from
that of supporting domestic circulation: it is founded on different
principles: it requires men of a particular genius to conduct it: the
difficulties to be met with are not constant; and therefore cannot
form a regular branch of bank administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The method of providing coin for domestic circulation is the
business of mints, not of banks.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have, in the third book, treated very fully of the doctrine
of coin, and of mints. I have shewn the difference between money,
which <em>is the scale for reckoning value</em>, and coin, which <em>is certain
denominations of money, realized in a proportional weight of the precious
metals</em>. I have shewn how necessary a thing it was to impose the
price of coinage upon the metals manufactured into coin: and
I have said, that it was inconsistent with all principles, to allege
that the metals, when coined, should thereby acquire no additional
value.</p>

<p class='c001'>The expence, therefore, of providing the metals should be thrown
upon those who want coin; and the mint should be obliged to convert
gold and silver into coin, upon the demander’s paying the
coinage.</p>

<p class='c001'>This coin loaded with the price of coinage, never will be sent
abroad to pay a foreign balance; never will be locked up in banks,
which will have little occasion for it. It will, therefore, remain in
circulation, and serve those purposes for which the inhabitants
think fit to employ it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This coin, I say, never will be exported, as long as any uncoined
metals can be found in the country: and if upon a national distress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>it is thought fit to facilitate the exportation of it, the state may (as
we observed above) appoint the mint to receive it back, in order to
melt it down into ingots, stamped with the mark of sterling, repaying
to the bearer —— <i>per cent.</i> of the coinage.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The trade of paying off foreign balances will then become
a particular branch of business: of which we shall treat more at
large, when we come to examine the principles of exchange.</p>

<p class='c001'>All that is necessary to be said in this place, is to recal the principle
we have mentioned above, viz. that when a nation cannot
pay in her metals, manufactures, and natural produce, what she
owes to strangers, she must pay in her solid property; that is, she
must mortgage the revenue of such property, for a capital <em>borrowed
out of the country</em>, which capital she must employ for the payment of
her foreign debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>This operation then should be performed by a regular and systematic
plan.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.20' class='c015'>CHAP. XX. <br /> <i>Objections to this Doctrine.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>That bank notes can never be received as specie, but from
a persuasion that they may be exchanged for it on demand.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this I answer, that it is sufficient they be received as value;
and that they answer every purpose in carrying on alienation. The
use of <em>money</em> is to keep the reckoning between parties, who are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>solvendo</i></span>;
the use of specie or coin is to avoid the inconvenience of
giving credit to persons who perhaps may not be so.</p>

<p class='c001'>When merchants make delivery in accompt, they then give credit
to their customers: when they sell for bank bills, they give
credit to the bank: when they are paid in coin, they give credit to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>no body; because they receive the real value in the coin. Where
then is the difference between receiving the real value, and receiving
an obligation for it, concerning the validity of which every one
in the country is perfectly satisfied?</p>

<p class='c001'>Is there a merchant, in any country in the world, who will sell
one farthing upon an hundred pounds cheaper to a person who
pays in coin, than to another who pays in good paper; unless the
extrinsic circumstances of the country should, at that time, give an
advanced price to the <em>metal</em> of which the coin is made.</p>

<p class='c001'>Money, we have said, ought to be invariable in its value: coin
never can be so, because it is both <em>money</em> and <em>merchandize</em>: money,
with respect to the denomination it carries by law; merchandize,
with respect to the metal it is made of.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is urged, that if I have coin I may pay any where within
the commercial world, at the expence of transportation, and insurance.
I grant this to be true.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I answer, that the principal use of coin, is, not to send
it out of the country; but to keep accompts clear among inhabitants
within the country. If there be a variation in the value of
coin, according to circumstances, that variation must affect the inhabitants
in their transactions. No one can gain upon this coin,
without supposing a relative loss to some other, whether they perceive
it or not. Must not this disturb all reckoning? Must it not
disturb prices? Since at different times, I may be paying the same
denominations of coin for the same commodity; and yet be paying,
really, more value at one time than at another. Is not then the
most invariable money the best calculated for the interest of trade,
and prosperity of manufactures? Whence arise complaints against
paper money, and regrets for want of coin? They issue from those
who both wish to profit of the rising value of the metals contained in
the coin, and who endeavour to persuade the public, that its interest,
and not their own, is their object.</p>

<p class='c001'>What a trifle is a foreign balance, let it be ever so great, compared
with the whole alienations of a country! Is it reasonable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>disturb the harmony of all domestic dealings, in order to furnish an
opportunity to a few clear-sighted people, who can, upon some occasions,
profit of the fluctuating value of the substance of which the
coin is composed, to the prejudice of the ignorant? If the country
owes a balance to other nations, let it be paid: nothing so just;
nothing so essential to the interest of the country which is the debtor.
If the precious metals are the most proper vehicles, as I may say, for
conveying this value, let them be procured and sent off; but never let
us say, that because <em>some</em> of our money <em>may</em> be made of that metal,
that all our money should be made of it; in order that those who
transact the balance may have an opportunity of sending our metals
away with greater ease, and thereby of depriving us of the means of
carrying on alienations among ourselves. Let every one that has
coin send it away: nothing can be more just; nothing more consistent
with principles: but let him send it away as a <em>manufacture</em>;
carrying in its bosom the price of making it, which he has paid,
and for which his foreign creditors will make him no allowance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Exchangers run to the coin of the nation, for paying, with the
least expence to themselves, the balance they are about to transact.
When that resource is cut off by the imposition of coinage, the nation
will preserve at least her darling specie; and then exchangers
will be obliged, by the best of all compulsions, their own interest,
to think of other expedients; bullion, manufactures, and natural
produce. And when all these come to fail, a regular plan must be
laid down, and authorised by government, for obtaining credit in
other countries, by mortgaging the revenue of the solid property
of the kingdom; according to the principles we shall discover when
we come to treat of exchange.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.2.21' class='c015'>CHAP. XXI. <br /> <i>How by a return of a favourable Balance the Bank may be enabled to pay off the Debts due to Foreigners, and thus deliver the Nation from that Burthen.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We have said, that the banks in contracting debts, and mortgaging
the property of Scotland to strangers, for the payment
of a grand balance, really acted as the guardians of the
public, by interposing their credit, and by constituting themselves
as debtors for the whole; taking for their relief, proportional securities
upon the effects of individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have also pointed out how, by this operation, the mass of
bank securities comes to be greatly augmented.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the payment of any balance for the behoof of Scotland,
the securities in the hands of the bank can only be equal to the
notes in domestic circulation, and accumulated profits thereon. Let
this be called (A). In proportion as these notes come back upon
the bank, in a demand for bills to pay balances, in the same proportion
is there a sum of securities added to the former mass
(granted upon new credits given for filling up the void thereby
occasioned to circulation) which quantity I shall call (B).</p>

<p class='c001'>(A) then represents the securities equivalent to the notes in circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>(B) represents the securities equivalent to the debts contracted by
the bank in favour of strangers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now let us suppose trade to become favourable; or that the interest
of the money, which the natives had sent abroad, to invest in
foreign countries, begins to flow back: what will be the effect of
this?</p>

<p class='c001'>I say, that this balance will be paid to Scotland, either in coin, or
in the metals, or in produce, or in manufactures, or in bills.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>In every case, it must be supposed to be beyond the consumption
of Scotland; otherwise it will not be a balance in their favour.
Whatever part of it, therefore, proves to be beyond the consumption
of Scotland, will be turned into money. This money must either
consist in the metals, or in foreign bills. If it consist in the metals,
it will, if coined, fill up, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro tanto</i></span>, a part of circulation; this will
make a proportional part of bank paper return upon the bank, and
extinguish a proportional part of their securities; which we have
called (A). But then there will be more coin in circulation than
formerly; consequently, more coin will enter into payments made
to the bank than formerly. But we must suppose, that before this
favourable turn of commerce, there was coin enough both in the
bank and in the country for the uses of domestic circulation; consequently,
the bank will send off this superfluity of coin, and with
it they will refund a part of the debt they formerly contracted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Through all this chain of reasoning, we must always suppose
the money in circulation to be <em>a determinate sum</em>; otherwise the superadding
this foreign balance in coin will not occasion, as we have
said, a return of a proportional part of the bank paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the next place, let us suppose this favourable balance to consist
in foreign bills, upon London, Amsterdam, &amp;c. These will be discounted
by the bank, and notes issued for them. The bills will be
sent off by the bank, in order still to extinguish a part of what is
owing to foreigners. These notes, again, being superfluous to
circulation, which we suppose to be full, will return upon the bank
and still diminish the mass of (A).</p>

<p class='c001'>By these operations we see how (A) will be constantly diminishing;
but then in the same proportion we see how the mass of
foreign debts will also be diminishing: consequently (B), which
was engaged for them, will be returning to be the free property of
the bank; and as we suppose no variation upon the sum in circulation,
we may consider this as a sort of conversion of (B) into (A),
and when all (B) shall be thus converted into (A), then the debt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>formerly contracted by the bank, in favour of Scotland, will be
totally paid off by the same method (only inverting the operations)
by which it was contracted.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.22' class='c015'>CHAP. XXII. <br /> <i>Of Banks of Circulation established on mercantile Credit.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>I have examined, with all the care I am capable of, the nature of
banks calculated for the melting down of solid property, and
converting it into paper for the use of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The nature of such banks is but little known in countries where
they have not been established, and a distinct account of them may
suggest hints, which in time may prove useful.</p>

<p class='c001'>People who do not employ their thoughts on the theory of trade
and credit, are apt to overlook objects of real utility; and those who
do, have seldom the opportunity of being informed of the customs
of different nations. Were my experience greater, or had I more
opportunities to dive into the recesses of this great object, the work
I now present to the public would better deserve its attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>I now proceed to a deduction of the principles upon which are
founded those banks which are principally calculated for the use of
commerce; and as the ground-work of my inquiry, I shall trace
some of the principal operations of the bank of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The establishment of this great company was formed about the
year 1694. Government at that time having great occasion for
money, a set of men was found who lent to it about 1,200,000<i>l</i>.
sterling, at 8 <i>per cent.</i> for the exclusive privilege of banking for 13
years; with this additional clause, that 4000<i>l.</i> sterling, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>,
should be given them to defray the expence of the undertaking.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>This sum of 1,200,000<i>l.</i> sterling, was the original bank stock. It
has been since increased to 11,000,000<i>l.</i> by farther loans to government,
for the prolongation of their privileges; as has been taken
notice of in the 16th chapter of the second part.</p>

<p class='c001'>This stock, as in banks of circulation upon mortgage, is only to
be considered as a subsidiary security to the public for the notes they
issue: were it the principal and only security for their paper, this
bank would then be founded on the principle of public, not of
mercantile credit; under which last denomination we are going to
point out in what the nature of it differs from those we have already
explained.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a rule with the bank of England to issue no notes upon mortgage,
permanent loan, or personal security. The principal branches
of their business may be comprehended under four articles, viz.
1. The circulation of the trade of London: 2. The exchequer business
of Great Britain: 3. The paying the interest of all the funds
transferable at the bank: 4. Their trade in gold and silver. I shall
now shortly explain the nature of these four great operations; and
first as to the circulation of the trade of London.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we speak of the circulation of trade, we understand the circulation
of money paid on the account of trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great occupation of the London merchants engages them to
simplify their business as much as possible. For this, they commit
to brokers every operation which requires no peculiar talents or ingenuity
in the merchant himself; and, for a like reason, they commit
to the bank and private bankers the care of their cash.</p>

<p class='c001'>A Scots merchant begins by drawing money from the bank, for
which he pays interest: a London merchant begins by putting
money into the bank, for which he draws no interest at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>A London merchant, therefore, can give no order upon the bank,
unless at a time when he has money lodged in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>If he has occasion for money at any time, he sends to the bank
the bills he has, before they become due, and the bank discounts
them at certain rates, according to their nature.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>If it be a foreign bill, the bank in discounting it, retains of the
sum, at the rate of 4 <i>per cent. per annum</i>, for the time the bill has to
run; but if the bill be at a longer day than 60 days, they will not
discount it. So in this case, the merchant must keep his bill until
it is within 60 days of the term of payment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason for this is evident: the security upon which such
bills stand, is purely mercantile. The nearer, therefore, the payment
is, the less risk the bank incurs from the failure of those who
are bound in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The intention of this operation of discounting bills, is plainly to
employ the cash in the bank in a way to draw an interest for it;
but as merchants allow their money to lie dead for as short a time
as they possibly can, the bank must have quick returns for what
they advance upon discount, in order to be constantly ready to answer
all demands. This is no loss to the bank, and a prodigious
advantage to trade, as I shall briefly explain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank is constantly receiving cash from every person who
keeps their cash with it. This occasions a constant fluctuation of
payments, which of course must leave at all times a considerable
sum of other people’s money in the bank; because it never is in
advance to any one.</p>

<p class='c001'>By long practice in the trade, this sum of money becomes determinate:
let us call it the <em>average-money</em> in the hands of the bank.
It is then with this average-money alone, that the bank can discount
bills. Now if the trade of London does afford bills to be
discounted at different dates within 60 days, sufficient to absorb the
whole average-money of the bank, appropriated for discounting;
this branch of business would not go forward with the celerity required
for the trade of London, did the bank indulge merchants
so far as to discount at a longer day.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we learn another reason why the bank of England discounts
no bill which has more than 60 days to run. The first,
mentioned already, is for the greater security of payment; and the
second, which we now discover, is in order to be able to discount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>more bills than otherwise they could do, did they discount at a
longer day.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I am here upon the subject of discounting bills of exchange
by the bank of England, an operation it has in common with all
the private bankers in the capital, I must answer a question I have
frequently heard proposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>How it happens, that in a city of so great trade as London, it is
possible that people should be found even among merchants, who
allow their money to remain in the hands of bankers without interest;
when in Scotland, a place of so little trade, interest may always
be got for money for the shortest time?</p>

<p class='c001'>The answer to this question is to be derived from the very principles
of trade itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The money which merchants have either in the hands of the
bank, or of bankers, though very considerable at all times, is in
perpetual fluctuation: it cannot then be lent to any but a banker,
who would consent to pay interest for the sums in hand. But no
such banker can be found, nor ever will be found, until all the
bankers in London consent to such a regulation. The reason is
plain. One principal use the bankers make of the average-money
in their hands, is the discounting of bills. Who then could pay
interest for money, and discount, in competition with others of the
same trade, who have it for nothing?</p>

<p class='c001'>But suppose the bank, and all the bankers in town, should come
to the resolution of giving interest for the money in their hands,
what would be the consequence?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that upon such an alteration, discount would rise above
the present rates, to the great prejudice of the trade of the nation;
and bankers would lend the money in their hands upon a more
precarious security for the sake of a higher interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the landed men who reside in London, and many other wealthy
people, not concerned in trade, constantly keep their money either
in the bank, or in some banker’s hand, without interest: this enables
bankers in general to discount foreign bills at 4 <i>per cent.</i> as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>has been said, even when the rate of interest is rather above that
standard. This is, as it were, a contribution from the rich and idle,
in favour of the trade of the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let, therefore, gentlemen who have much idle money, think of
any other expedient than that of obtaining interest for it, from
those who discount bills in London. Not one of them can afford
to do it, and thrive by his business; and the hurt which would
result to trade in general, will constantly be a sufficient bar against
a general resolution for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has been said, will, I hope, prove satisfactory as to the resolution
of the question above proposed, so far as regards London. It
remains to be answered, how those who supply the place of bankers
in Scotland, and even the banks themselves, can afford to pay interest
for any sum put into their hands for a short time.</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that as to the Scotch exchangers, as we have called
them, the profits on their trade admit of borrowing money at interest,
which that of the bank of England and private bankers cannot
do. If these last can gain 4 or 5 <i>per cent.</i> by discounting of bills,
it is all they can honestly expect: every other employment of the
money in their hands is precarious, either as to the security or
promptitude of calling it in, to answer the demands which are
made upon them.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the Scotch banks, we have seen how directly contrary to
all principles it is, to borrow money in Scotland. How it diminishes
the profits upon their own trade, and hurts the circulation of
the country; but although it diminishes their profit, it carries
along with it no positive loss to them, as would be the case with a
London banker, who would pay interest for all the money in his
hands, when he never can draw any back, except for that part
which we have called the average.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every London banker is obliged to have a certain sum of cash
constantly in his chest, the interest of which would be all lost, did
he pay for it: whereas the exchangers in Scotland never have a
shilling by them; and when any demand is made upon them, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>draw the money from the banks, in consequence of their credit by
cash accompts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides foreign bills, which the bank of England discounts at
4 <i>per cent.</i> they also discount inland bills, and notes of hand between
merchants in London, at 5 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The inland bills to be discounted at the bank must all be payable
in London. The bank calls in no money from any distant quarter
of the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the discounting of notes of hand between London merchants
might operate the same effect, as if the bank should advance them
money upon personal security, in case the notes were drawn for
obtaining credit, in place of paying money really due between
the merchants, in the course of business, the clerks of the bank
keep a watchful eye over this branch of management, and, by
examining the reciprocal draughts of merchants between themselves,
they easily acquire a knowledge of the state of their affairs,
and are thereby enabled to judge how far it is expedient to launch
out in discounting either the notes or bills wherein they are concerned.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall not pretend to assign a reason why, in the price of discount,
the bank makes a difference of 1 <i>per cent.</i> between foreign and inland
bills of exchange. It may either be an indulgence and encouragement
to foreign trade; or it may be upon the consideration of
the better security of foreign bills, which commonly pass through
several indorsations before they are offered to be discounted at the
bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>I come next to the circulation between the bank and the exchequer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank of England is to the exchequer, what a private person’s
banker is to him. It receives the cash of the exchequer, and answers
its demands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cash comes to the exchequer from the amount of taxes. The
two great branches of which are the excise and customs. To explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>this operation with the more distinctness, I shall take the example
of the excise.</p>

<p class='c001'>The excise is computed to bring in annually from London, and
the fifty two collections over all England, nett into the exchequer,
above four and a half millions sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fifty two collectors send the amount of their collections to
London eight times a year, <em>almost entirely in bills</em>. As the same may
be said of the remittances of all the other taxes, we may from this
circumstance observe by the way, that London alone must constantly
owe to the country of England a sum equal to all the bills drawn
upon it; that is to say, to all the taxes which the country pays:
a circumstance not to be overlooked, from which many things may
be learned, as will be taken notice of in the proper place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bills sent by the fifty two collectors, are drawn payable to
the commissioners of excise; they indorse them to the receiver
general; he carries them to the bank as they fall due, and gets a
receipt for the amount; this receipt he carries to the exchequer,
who charge it in their account with the bank, and deliver tallies to
the receiver general for the amount of his payments; these tallies
he delivers to the commissioners of excise, who enter them in their
book of tallies. This operation is performed once every week, and
serves as a discharge from the commissioners to the receiver general.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank, again, keeps an account with the exchequer, which
is settled once every day, by two clerks, who go from the bank to
the exchequer for that purpose. When coin is wanted by the exchequer,
for payments where bank notes will not answer, the coin
is furnished by the bank; when paper will serve the purpose, paper
is issued.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides this operation in the receipt of taxes, the bank advances
to government, that is to the exchequer, the amount of the land or
other taxes imposed, which are to be levied within the year. This
we see is a loan upon <em>government security for a short term</em>, quite consistent
with the principles upon which the bank is established. The large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>sums the bank is constantly receiving of public money, and the
great assistance it obtains from thence in carrying on the other
branches of their trade, enable it at present to make advances of
money to government at 3 <i>per cent.</i> It observes the same rule with
respect to the great companies of the East Indies, and South Sea,
for the same reason: but no advances are made to private people;
and in discounting of bills and notes of hand, the regulations above
mentioned are adhered to.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the whole amount of taxes is poured into the bank, in the
manner we have been describing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank also keeps the transfer books of all the funds negotiated
at the bank; and out of the public money in its hand, it pays
the interest of those debts, for which government allows to the
bank a sum proportionate to the expence of that branch of management.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the bank, as a company, lends to government upon a permanent
fund, the capital whereof is not demandable, this operation
is foreign to their business as a bank, and is conducted by the company,
as an article of management of their private property.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now examine by what channels their notes enter into circulation,
and the security upon which they stand.</p>

<p class='c001'>When issued in the discount of bills, they stand upon the principles
of mercantile credit, and depend upon the goodness of the
bills discounted. When issued upon the faith of taxes to be paid
within the year, they stand upon the security of that payment,
which is of a very complex nature, as any one may perceive. As
long as the inhabitants of England consume exciseable goods, the
excise will be paid: as long as trade goes on, customs will be paid:
and as long as government subsists, the collateral security of the
state will serve to make up all deficiencies in the amount of taxes.
No security, therefore, can be better than the notes of the bank of
England, while government subsists. The losses that great company
meet with from bad debts, I am informed, are very inconsiderable.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>The greatest risk the bank runs, is in discounting bad bills; but
by the extent of their business in this branch, and by circulating the
cash of all the merchants who keep accounts with them, they acquire
so perfect a knowledge of the state of their affairs, that it
rarely happens that any one can fail for very considerable sums,
without the bank’s having a previous notice of it. A sudden loss
may no doubt happen, without a possibility of being foreseen; but
the matter of fact proving that their losses upon bad bills are inconsiderable,
we may thence infer, that there is but little mystery
to the bank, with regard to the credit of London merchants.</p>

<p class='c001'>I come now to the last branch of their management, to wit, their
trade in gold and silver.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the circulation of bank notes, coin is necessary. We have
seen, in treating of the Scotch banks, how coin is brought in: to
wit, in consequence of all the payments made to the bank, in
which there must be a proportion of coin equal to what is found in
common circulation. What is not paid in coin, comes in, in their
own notes, which are thereby taken out of the circle; and consequently
make place for a subsequent supply, which issues in the
manner we have described.</p>

<p class='c001'>In times of peace, and a favourable balance of trade, the bank
suffers little by the obligation it is under to pay in coin, except so
far as the great confusion of the present currency affords an occasion
to money-jobbers to melt down the new guineas. The extent
of this traffic I am no judge of, and the bank no doubt has an interest
in preventing it as far as the laws have provided a remedy
against it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But when large payments are to be made abroad, the distress of
the bank is no doubt very great.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Scotland, the banks, upon such occasions, are totally drained
of coin. They have no market for the metals; because they have
no mint to manufacture them into coin. It is different with respect
to the bank of England; their distress proceeds from another
cause.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>The exportation of the heavy guineas in time of war, and of a
wrong balance upon the trade of England, leaves circulation provided
with a light currency, in which the bank is obliged to pay
their notes; and the intrinsic value of the gold in which they pay,
regulates the price of the metals they are obliged to buy at market.
If they provide them themselves from abroad, they must pay the
price of them in bills of exchange. But then the lightness of the
currency at home, sinks the value of the pound sterling, as it raises
the value of the ounce of gold and silver. So the only considerable
loss they incur, is in providing the metals, which must ever be
considerable, so long as the old guineas remain in circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The loss upon coining silver is still greater than upon gold; because,
besides the loss incurred by reason of the lightness of the
gold, the metals in the silver and gold coin of Great Britain, are
not proportional to the value they bear in the London market,
where they have been bought, as has been sufficiently explained
already in another place<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. See Book III. Chap. 21. Quest. 7.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is with great diffidence that I propose an expedient to a company
so knowing in the arts and science of trade, for preventing, in a great
measure, this loss in providing the metals for the use of circulation.
The bank is directed by long experience, and by a knowledge of
many facts and circumstances hid from me; and which, therefore,
I cannot combine into a theory founded chiefly upon reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>The expedient I propose has been pointed out in the preceeding
parts of this inquiry, and I only recapitulate it briefly in this place,
to recal it to mind while we are on the subject of the bank of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, then, while the coin is of unequal weight, the value of the
currency never can be permanently the same. Did the bank seriously
set about forming a plan for the reformation of the coin, I
have no doubt but government, as well as the voice of the nation,
would go along with it in forwarding the execution of so noble a
design.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>The second step I would recommend, is that government should
enable the bank to establish a fund in Holland, Antwerp, Hamburg,
and perhaps at Cadiz and Lisbon, for borrowing (though at
a high interest) sums of money equal to what may be due by England
to the continent upon certain emergencies.</p>

<p class='c001'>I cannot pretend to lay down any plan for this operation; but I
proceed upon this principle: that if on like occasions the British
government can find credit to borrow so large sums for the uses of
war, at a very moderate interest, surely the bank of England may
imitate her example for the uses of trade; and had she a credit
abroad, upon which she could draw, I think it must follow, that
the coin of the nation might be kept at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have been an eye witness to large sums in new English guineas
thrown into the melting pots of the Dutch mints, for the small
profit of less than 1 <i>per cent.</i> gained by coining them into ducats.
A small duty imposed upon coinage in the English mint, would
prevent this practice abroad; and then British coin would come
safe back again, upon every return of a favourable balance on their
trade. At present it comes home in bullion, which the bank must
buy dear; the state must coin at a considerable expence; and the
bank after all must give it to circulation at the mint price, which
is many <i>per cent.</i> below prime cost, as matters have stood for several
years.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this review of the constitution of the bank of England, and
of the principles upon which it is founded, we may discover how
impossible it is, that banks upon mortgage and private credit, can
ever receive any considerable assistance from it; and how groundless
all insinuations concerning its jealousy of such companies
must be.</p>

<p class='c001'>A more natural object of its jealousy is that of the London bankers,
who carry on a trade similar to its own, in many respects, and who,
in the course of their business, draw from it very large quantities
of coin.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>This, however, occasions no ill will on the part of the bank.
The trade of London requires the assistance of all the bankers there,
as well as of the bank. Were it otherwise, the bank, by discounting
bills at a less profit, might soon oblige them to shut up shop.
In this view of the matter, the drawing coin from the bank cannot
be prevented.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bankers call for no more than their business requires. Could
the bank, therefore, circulate the whole trade of London, the consequence
would be, to issue as much coin as at present: and the
coin which issues from bankers, like to that which issues from the
bank, if it be for the uses of domestic circulation, returns to the
bank in proportion as it issues: and if it be for payment of a foreign
balance, the bank knows well that the expence of providing for
<em>that</em>, must land upon it, in spite of every method to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must now explain the difference between the effects produced
upon the circulation of coin, by the operations of banks established
upon mortgage and private credit, and by those of the bank of
England, which we have said to be established upon mercantile
security.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence of a bank upon mortgage, is to fill the nation
with paper money, and to reduce the quantity of coin to the lowest
sum possible. For the truth of this proposition, I appeal to the experience
of Scotland, and of Rome, where banks upon mortgage, and
moveable pledges, are found established. From these facts, and from
the principles of their constitution, which is to melt down property
into money, it follows, that when the credit of such money is well
established, the coin, which is the money of the world, will be
employed in trading with the world, and the paper, which is the
money of the society, will be employed in trading with the society.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence of this, is, that when the balance of trade runs
against a country where banks upon mortgage are established, the
coin first goes out; and when, by borrowing, it can be brought back,
the interest paid for the coin borrowed, adds an additional balance
against the country, until the whole revenue of it becomes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>property of other nations. From this we may conclude, that the
establishment of such banks is as dangerous a weapon in the hands
of an idle nation, as an extensive credit is to the family of a young
spendthrift.</p>

<p class='c001'>But let us consider the consequences of such banks to an industrious
people, who preserve, upon the average of their trade, a favourable
balance with other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The coin, then, goes out to return, and serves as a check upon
the course of exchange. I here suppose proper regulations in the
mint, and an entire liberty to export coin. Permitting the exportation
of coin where you have a mint, for paper to supply its place,
and a favourable balance on your trade to bring it back, is like
establishing two shops for the course of exchange. If the exchanger
will not serve trade at the price of transportation and insurance, the
coin will do it for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In such a country, a bank, properly established, will find great
profit upon the interest of their notes, notwithstanding of the obligation
to provide, at all times, the quantity of coin necessary for
circulation. All the great objects of trade will then be fulfilled;
the rest must be left to the operation of political causes.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the balance of the trade of such a country should have the effect
of bringing in an addition of coin, which, because of the paper,
would become unnecessary for circulation; this coin, or the value
of it, will either be added to their stock in trade, or will be lent to
other nations. This is the case of the Swiss: they are an industrious
and a frugal people; they receive annually from their trade, and
from the service of their citizens in many countries in Europe, a
constant addition to their wealth, more than their trade demands,
which they lend to their neighbours; by these means they increase
the revenue of the society; and this increase has effects almost
similar to an extension of their territory; because it is a means of
increasing their population beyond the proportion of the natural
produce of their lands; and the food they import from Germany
and other countries, is paid with the money which arises from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>interest of what they have lent abroad. All these operations are the
consequences of credit and circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a country where a mercantile bank is established, the melting
down of property is greatly circumscribed; and consequently coin
becomes more necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have often said, that a circulating value (money) must constantly
bear a proportion to alienation. Circumstances will determine
what proportion of coin and what proportion of paper will be
necessary for carrying it on. These circumstances, under banks of
circulation upon mortgage, multiply paper so much that little coin
is required.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now examine how far the paper of a mercantile bank, like
that of England, tends to supply the demand of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were no bank established at London, all bills would be paid, or
discounted in coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank, therefore, melts down into paper money all the bills
discounted by them, and throws it into circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>It also melts down into paper all the sums it advances either to
government, or to the great trading companies. In this respect it
acts upon the principle of banks upon mortgage.</p>

<p class='c001'>It also melts down into paper all the interest upon the public
funds discounted at the bank. All this sum of paper issues from
the bank into the city of London, and proportionally supplies the
circulation of that great capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine how this paper can find its way into the
country of England, there to supply the use of coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole consumption of London for meat, beer, fire, and an
infinity of articles of manufacture for domestic use and foreign
exportation, comes from the country of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did the country owe nothing to London, the sums due for those
commodities would be sent into the country in the current circulation
of London, which, by what we have seen, absorbs a very
large quantity of paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we have said above, that the whole amount of taxes, almost,
is remitted to London in bills: this could not be the case, were not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>the capital constantly indebted to the country. This circumstance
confines the circulation of bank notes chiefly to London, and some
other cities, to which the inhabitants of London resort, and whither
they carry in their pockets the money of the capital, viz. bank
notes. For these reasons, bank notes can never be common in the
country: and if, at any time, a scarcity of currency <em>there</em>, proves
hurtful to industry, the defect cannot be remedied but by establishing
banks of circulation upon mortgage in the principal towns of
England.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be here objected that such a regulation in England, where
there is already so great a bank settled on different principles, might
draw along with it the following hurtful consequences, viz.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, By multiplying the circulation of paper it would send off the
coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The taxes would be paid in this paper, which could not be
received at the bank of England, and that would throw the whole
nation into confusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>To which I answer, 1. That if the coin were sent off, it would
return, as has been said, while the trade of England flourishes: and
2. That this new bank paper coming in place of the coin, would
no more be sent to London than coin is sent now. The debts due
by the country for taxes, would be compensated by the reciprocal
debts due by London for subsistence, &amp;c. and the compensation
would go on as at present by bills: but were the case otherwise,
and did a change of circumstances oblige the country to make delivery
in coin to London, the holders of the country notes would
constantly, as is the case in Scotland, have recourse to the bank
established in the district, for the coin wanted to be sent to London.</p>

<p class='c001'>When I accidentally, as at present, happen to apply a principle
to a particular case, whereby an innovation is implied, I constantly
fear a secret rebuke from many impatient readers. I therefore beg
a little indulgence upon account of my good intention, which is
only to support ideas to be approved of, or rejected by those who
have the capacity to form plans upon them, and power to put them
in execution.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.2.23' class='c015'>CHAP. XXIII. <br /> <i>Of the first Establishment of Mr. Law’s Bank in France, in the Year 1716.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In deducing the principles of credit, I have it chiefly in view, to
set in a fair light, the security upon which paper-money is established:
and as I imagine, this important branch of my subject
will still be rendered more intelligible, by an example of the abuse
to which this great engine of commerce is exposed, I now propose
to give my reader a short account of the famous bank of circulation
first established in France by Mr. Law; but afterwards prostituted
(whether by design, or by fatality, I shall not here determine)
to serve the worst of purposes; the defrauding the creditors
of the state, and a multitude of private persons.</p>

<p class='c001'>So dreadful a calamity brought upon that nation, by the abuse
of paper credit, may be a warning to all states to beware of the
like. The best way to guard against it, is to be apprised of the
delusion of it, and to see through the springs and motives by which
the Missisippi bank was conducted.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the death of the late King of France, Louis XIV. the debts
contracted by that Monarch were found to extend to 2000 millions
of livres, that is, to upwards of 140 millions sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was proposed to the Duke of Orleans, regent of the kingdom,
to expunge the debts by a total bankruptcy. This proposal
he rejected nobly; and instead of it, established a commission
(called the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Visa</i></span>) to inquire into the claims of such of the nation’s
creditors as were not then properly liquidated, nor secured by the
appropriation of any fund for the payment of the interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of this commission, many exorbitant frauds were
discovered; by which it appeared, that vast sums of debt had been
contracted, for no adequate value paid to the King.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>After many arbitrary proceedings, this commission threw the
King’s debts, at last, into a kind of order.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those formerly provided for were all put at 4 <i>per cent.</i> The creditors
to the amount of six hundred millions, which had not been
liquidated, nor provided for, had their claims reduced, by the
commission, to two hundred and fifty millions; for which they
obtained notes of state, (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Billets d’etat</i></span>, as they were called) bearing
an interest of 4 <i>per cent.</i> also.</p>

<p class='c001'>These operations performed, the total debts of the late King
were reduced to the sum above mentioned; to wit, two thousand
millions; bearing an interest of 4 <i>per cent.</i> or eighty millions <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per
annum</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the necessities of government, and the distressed situation
of the kingdom, this interest was ill paid: and there hardly remained,
out of an ill paid revenue, wherewith to defray the expence
of the civil government.</p>

<p class='c001'>About this time Mr. Law presented to the Regent the plan of a
bank of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the better understanding this affair of Mr. Law’s bank, and
the views he had in establishing it at that time, I must give a short
account of the most material variations of the French coin, before
and after the King’s death, 1st September 1715; which I shall
make as short as possible, consistently with perspicuity.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.24' class='c015'>CHAP. XXIV. <br /> <i>Account of the variations of the French coin, some time before and after the death of Louis XIV.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>In 1709, there was a new general coinage in France; by which
operation the King gained 23<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>13</sub> <i>per cent.</i> upon all the specie
coined. (Dutot, vol. i. p. 104.)</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Out of the marc of standard gold were coined 30 louis d’ors, of
20 livres denomination each. Out of the marc of standard silver,
8 crowns, of 5 livres denomination each: so that the silver was
put at 40 livres the marc.—But,</p>

<p class='c001'>By edict of the month of September 1713, the old King appointed
a diminution of the denomination of silver and gold coins;
by which, after eleven successive changes, the coin of France was
ordered to be brought down, from 40 livres the marc, to 28: so
that the 8 crowns, which were <em>called</em> 40 livres in the month of
September 1713, by the 2d day of September 1715, (the day after
the King’s death) were to be <em>called</em> only 28 livres. I say <em>called</em>, because
certainly the crowns had suffered no variation but in their
name.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the 13th of August 1715, (a few days before the King’s death)
he issued a declaration; ordering that for the future the coin
should remain at 28 livres <em>per</em> marc.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this I conclude, that his intention was to leave, at his
death, the coin of his kingdom of the same standard he had found
it to be at the beginning of his reign, and at which he had preserved
it invariably, during the flourishing state of his kingdom,
for the space of 46 years; that is, until the year 1689.</p>

<p class='c001'>He could not fail to be sensible of the infinite prejudice occasioned
to debtors and creditors by the variations he had practised
upon the coin from 1689.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this standard, then, it was brought the very day after his
death, and no sooner: therefore his debt of two thousand millions of
livres should regularly be estimated according to that rate; or at
about 40 shillings sterling for every 28 livres: 40 shillings being,
within a trifle, the value of 8 ounces or one marc of standard
silver, Paris weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this rate of conversion, the two thousand millions were equal
to 142,857,140<i>l</i>. sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>Soon after the King’s death, on the 2d of January 1716, the new
ministry issued an edict, which totally destroyed all. This was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>most extraordinary operation, I believe, ever invented; and to it
was owing the establishment of Mr. Law’s bank: I must therefore
explain it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There had been no general coinage since 1709; the louis d’or
had then been coined at 20 livres, and the crowns at 5, as has been
said. The edict of 2d January 1716, ordered a new general coinage,
on the same footing, both as to weight, fineness, and denomination,
as that of 1709: the only difference was, that the first
had an old man’s head upon it; the other had that of a child of
six years old.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this first operation, there was an end put to the former diminutions
on the denomination of the coin; which was now raised
again to 40 livres the marc, as in 1709<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a>. This is nothing:</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. Here is also an operation upon debts. The day before this edict, that is, the 1st
of January 1716, the value of the King’s debts was (as has been said) above 142
millions sterling: but an edict comes, raising the coin to 40 livres <i>per</i> marc; and consequently,
reducing the debts to the value of 100 millions sterling.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There being no difference between the old coin and the new,
except the stamp, the old coin was called in, and a new face was
stamped on the very same pieces. But when the louis d’ors were
called in, they were received at the mint at no more than 16 livres;
and by a stroke of the wheel, they were, in an instant, converted
into 20 livres, the denomination of the new coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus a person who brought 20 old louis d’ors to the mint, received
back 16 of his own 20, new stamped, and no injustice was
said to be done, from this demonstration of ministerial algebra,
viz. 16 × 20 = 20 × 16. Can any thing be more clear and instructive!
Some of my readers may not give credit to this; but it is
true nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under these circumstances, it was natural for the inhabitants to
wish to dispose of their old coin, at any other market than at the
King’s mint. They did what they could to smuggle it to Holland;
where the industrious Dutchman stamped a 16 livre piece with the
head of a child, as well as the King of France could do, and sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>it back to France for a 20 livre piece. These operations were prevented
as well as government could; and every method was tried
to force in the old coin to the mint.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Law judged this a very proper occasion to form the plan of a
bank of circulation, upon the principles we have already explained.</p>

<p class='c001'>He gave in his scheme to the Duke of Orleans; by whom it was
approved of; and the bank was established the 2d of May of the
same year 1716.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first thing Mr. Law did, was to buy up with bank notes this
old coin, at a price above what the mint gave, but many <i>per cent.</i>
below the proportion of its value: his paper (payable in the new
coin at 40 livres <i>per</i> marc) was run upon for this, as well as other
reasons; and an immense profit ensued.</p>

<p class='c001'>This anecdote, I think, is curious, and tends to unfold Mr. Law’s
combinations, in the proposal he made to the Duke of Orleans for
erecting a bank at this period of time.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.25' class='c015'>CHAP. XXV. <br /> <i>Continuation of the Account of Law’s Bank.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>The bank accordingly was established in favour of Law and
Company, by letters patent, of the 2d of May 1716. The
Company was called, the General Bank; and the note run thus:</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank promises to pay to the bearer at sight — livres, in coin
of the same weight and fineness with the coin of this day, value
received at Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first fund of this bank consisted in 1200 actions (or shares)
of one thousand crowns, (or 5000 livres) bank money; in all six
millions; the crown being then 5 livres, 8 to the marc; silver
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>coin at 40 livres <i>per</i> marc, as has been said; which makes this
livre just worth one shilling sterling: consequently, the shares
were worth 250<i>l.</i> sterling, and the bank stock worth 300,000<i>l</i>.
sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the clause in the note, by which the bank was obliged to pay
according to the then weight and fineness of the coin, those who
received their paper were secured against the arbitrary measures
common in France of raising the denomination of the coin; and
the bank was secured against the lowering of it. In a short time,
most people preferred the notes to the coin; and accordingly they
passed for 1 <i>per cent.</i> more than the coin itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>This bank subsisted, and obtained great credit, until the 1st of January
1719: at which time the King reimbursed all the proprietors
of the shares, and took the bank into his own hand, under the
name of the Royal Bank<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. Here the bank departed from the principles of private and mercantile credit,
upon which Law had formed it, and proceeded upon those of public credit. Public
credit in France is the credit of the Sovereign; the solidity of which depends upon
the maxims which he follows in the course of his administration.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Upon this revolution, the tenor of the note was changed. It
ran thus: The bank promises to pay to the bearer, at sight, —
livres, <em>in silver coin</em>, value received at Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this alteration, the money in the notes was made to keep
pace with the money in the coin; and both were equally affected
by every arbitrary variation upon it. This was called, rendring
the paper <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>monnoie fixe</i></span>; because the denominations contained in it
did not vary according to the variations of the coin: I should have
called it <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>monnoie variable</i></span>; because it was exposed to changes with
respect to its real value.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Law strenuously opposed this change in the bank notes. No
wonder! it was diametrically opposite to all principles of credit.
It took place, however; and no body seemed dissatisfied: the nation
was rather pleased: so familiar were the variations of the coin
in those days, that no body ever considered any thing with regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>to coin or money, but its denomination: the consequences of the
variations in the value of denominations, upon the accompts between
debtors and creditors, were not then attended to; and the
credit of the notes of the royal bank continued just as good as
that of Mr. Law; although the livres in <em>this</em> contained a determinate
value; and the livres in <em>that</em> could have been reduced at any
time to the value of halfpence, by an act of the King’s authority,
who was the debtor in them. Nay more, they in fact stood many
variations during the course of the system, without suffering the
smallest discredit. This appears wonderful; and yet it is a fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>Political writers upon the affairs of France at this period, such
as De Melon, Savarie, Dutot, and others, abundantly certify the
incredible advantage produced by the operations of Mr. Law’s
bank; and the chain of events which followed, in the years 1719,
and 1720, when it was in the King’s hands, shew to what a prodigious
height credit arose upon the firm foundation laid by Mr.
Law<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. Dutot, speaking of the great value of paper in notes and actions, throws out several
reflections, in the passage I am now to transcribe from him, which, at the same
time that they prove the great advantages resulting to France from the establishment of
credit among them, abundantly evince how lame this author’s ideas were concerning
the principles of paper credit, and of circulation. He says, (vol. ii. p. 200.) “<em>This
paper</em> was indeed just so much real value, which credit and confidence had created,
in favour of the state: and by this sum was circulation augmented, independently
of all the coin which was then in France.”</p>

<p class='c001'>"Upon this revolution, Plenty immediately displayed herself through all the towns,
and all the country. She there relieved our citizens and labourers from the oppression
of debts, which indigence had obliged them to contract: she revived industry:
she restored that value to every fund, which had been suspended by those debts:
she enabled the King to liberate himself, and to make over to his subjects, for more
than fifty-two millions of taxes, which had been imposed in the years preceeding
1719; and for more than thirty-five millions of other duties, extinguished during
the regency. This plenty sunk the rate of interest; crushed the usurer; carried
the value of lands to eighty and a hundred years purchase; raised up stately edifices
both in town and country; repaired the old, which were falling to ruin; improved
the soil; gave a value to every fruit produced by the earth, which before that time
had none at all. Plenty recalled those citizens, whom misery had forced to seek
their livelihood abroad. In a word, riches flowed in from every quarter. Gold,
silver, precious stones, ornaments of all kinds, which contribute to luxury and magnificence,
came to us from every country in Europe. Whether these prodigies, or
marvellous effects, were produced by art, by confidence, by fear, or by whim if
you please, one must agree, that that art, that confidence, that fear, or that whim,
had operated all these <em>realities</em> which the antient administration never could have
produced.</p>

<p class='c001'>"What a difference in the situation of France at the beginning of the regency,
and the situation in which she was in November 1719!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus far the system had produced nothing but good: every thing was commendable,
and worthy of admiration.” These are the sentiments of Dutot, concerning
this system of paper credit.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>But alas! the superstructure, then, became so far beyond the
proportion of the foundation, that the whole fabric fell to ruin,
and involved a nation, just emerging from bankruptcy and inanition,
into new calamities, almost equal to the former.</p>

<p class='c001'>As long as the credit of this bank subsisted, it appeared to the
French to be perfectly solid. The bubble no sooner burst, than the
whole nation was thrown into astonishment and consternation.
No body could conceive from whence the credit had sprung; what
had created such mountains of wealth in so short a time; and by
what witchcraft and fascination it had been made to disappear in
an instant, in the short period of one day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Volumes have been since writ in France, by men of speculation,
in order to prove, that it was a want of confidence in the public,
and not the want of a proper security for the paper, which occasioned
this downfal.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, if we judge by what has been writ, has been the general
opinion of that nation to this day: and since it was found impossible,
in France, to create confidence in circulating paper, which
had no security for its value, many people there, and some even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>among ourselves, conclude, that a great part of the wealth of
Great Britain, which consists in paper, well secured, is false and
fictitious.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now proceed to set before my reader the great lines of the
royal Mississippi bank of France, from the 1st of January 1719, to
the total overthrow of all credit, upon the fatal 21st day of May
1720. This was a golden dream, in which the French nation, and
a great part of Europe was plunged, for the short space of 506
days.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.26' class='c015'>CHAP. XXVI. <br /> <i>Account of the Royal Mississippi Bank of France, established on Public Credit.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>In order to unravel the chaos of this affair in a proper manner,
it will not be amiss to begin by giving the reader an idea of
the plan which naturally might suggest itself to the Regent of
France, from the hint of Mr. Law’s bank. By the help of this
clue, he will be the better able to conduct himself through the
operations of this <em>system</em>, as the French call it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Regent perceived, that in consequence of the credit of Law’s
bank, people grew fond of paper-money. The consequence of
this, he saw, was, to bring a great quantity of coin into the bank.
The debts of France were very great, being, as has been said,
above 2000 millions. The coin, at that time, in France, was
reckoned at about 1200 millions, at 60 livres the marc, or 40 millions
sterling. The Regent thought, that if he could draw either
the whole, or even the greatest part of this 1200 millions of coin
into his bank, and replace the use of it to the kingdom, by as
much paper, secured upon his word, that he should then be able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>to pay off, with it, near one half of all the debts of France: and by
thus throwing back the coin into circulation, in paying off the
debts, that it would return of itself into the bank, in the course of
payments made to the state; that credit would be thereby supported,
as the bank would be enabled to pay in coin the notes as
they happened to return, in the course of domestic circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was both a plausible and an honest scheme, relatively to a
Duke of Orleans, whom we cannot suppose to have been master of
the principles of credit; and very practicable in a country where
there was so great a quantity of coin as 40 millions sterling, and a
well established credit in the bank, which prevented all runs upon
it from diffidence. Nothing but a wrong balance of trade could
have occasioned any run for coin; because, for the reason already
given, the paper bore for the most part a premium of 1 <i>per cent.</i>
above it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly, during the whole year 1719, the credit of the royal
bank was without suspicion, although the Regent had, by the last
day of December of that year, coined of bank paper, for no less a
sum than 769 millions, reckoning in 59 millions of paper, which
had been formerly issued by the <em>general bank of Law and company</em>; for
which he had given value to the proprietors, when he took the bank
into his own hands, as we have said above.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must here observe, that by this plan of the Regent, there was,
in one sense, a kind of security for the notes issued. So far as they
were issued for coin brought in from the advanced value of the
paper, this coin was the security: in the second place, when the
coin was paid away to the creditors of the state, the Regent withdrew
the obligations which had been granted to them; and although
I allow that the King’s own obligation withdrawn, was no
security to the public, who had received bank notes for the payment;
yet still the interest formerly paid to the creditors, was a
fund out of which, upon the principles of public credit, the annual
interest for the notes was secured. Had, indeed, the French nation
perceived upon what bottom the security for the paper stood, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the year 1719, perhaps the credit of the bank might have been
rendred precarious; but they neither saw it or sought after it: and
the men of speculation were all of opinion, that as long as there
was no more paper issued by the bank <em>than there was coin in the kingdom</em>,
there could be no harm done. Of this any person who has
read Dutot, de Melon, Savarie, and others, will be perfectly satisfied<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a>.
And I desire no farther proof of the total ignorance of the
French in matters of this kind, than to find them agreeing, that
bank paper is always good, providing there be coin in the nation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>to realize it, although that coin be not the property of the bank.
[Dutot, p. 132, 133.] On the contrary, it is very evident from
what has been said, that although there should be a thousand times
more coin in a country than the bank paper, still that bank paper
must be a mere delusion, and, in fact, of no value whatsoever, except
so far as the bank is possessed of the value of it in one species
of property or another.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. It is astonishing to find how gravely Messrs. de Melon and Dutot reasoned concerning
the nature of paper money, and the effects of changing the value of the coin.
They both seemed to agree that a livre was a livre whether it was the 28th or the 50th
part of a marc of silver, whether it was a denomination upon paper, well or ill secured,
no matter which.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole reasoning turned merely on the question, who were robbed, and who
fantastically enriched by such absurd operations upon the coin of a country?</p>

<p class='c001'>The jargon of such men certainly contributed a great deal to darken the understandings
of the ministry at this time; and to make them believe that the affairs of money
were infinitely more obscure and more difficult to be understood than they really are.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are thousands of examples where mankind, with their learning and reasoning,
have turned common sense into inextricable science; this I think is a famous instance of
it: and it is rendring no small service to the world, to destroy, in a manner, what
others have been at so much pains to establish. This is restoring common sense to its
native dress, in which it becomes intelligible to every one.</p>

<p class='c001'>I know very well that the ministry of France have now very different notions concerning
paper credit; but these notions have not as yet reached the press, except in
some of the King’s answers to the remonstrances of the parliament of Paris in 1760.
These answers were dictated upon sound principles, and do great honour to the ministry.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old notions still prevailed in the remonstrances of the parliament. This plainly
appears from the proposal they made to the King, at that time, to issue paper to the
amount of 200 millions, which the parliament was to make good. An expedient to
avoid doing that which right reason demanded of them, viz. first to secure a fund for
the paper, and then to borrow upon that fund. This proposal from the parliament,
and the King’s rejecting it, proves that credit was then better understood in the cabinet
than in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>palais</i></span>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And on the other hand, let the bank paper exceed the quantity
of coin in the proportion of a thousand to one, yet still it is perfectly
good and sufficient, providing the bank be possessed of an
equivalent value in any species of good property. This I throw in
here to point out how far the French were, at least at that time, and
many years after, when Dutot and Melon wrote, from forming any
just notion of the principles of banking. And, I believe, I may
venture to say, that the only reason why banks have never been
established in France, is, because the whole operation is still a mystery
to them. I ground this conjecture upon an opinion of M. de
Montesquieu, who thinks that banks are incompatible with pure
monarchy; a proposition he would never have advanced had he
understood the principles upon which they are established.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next remarkable and interesting revolution made upon this
famous bank, was by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of February 22, 1720; which constituted
the union of the royal bank with the company of the Indies.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span>, the King delivered to that company the whole management
of the bank with all the profits made by him since the
first of January 1719, and in time coming. Notwithstanding this
cession, the King remained guarantee for all the notes, which were
not to be coined without an order of council: the company was to
be responsible to the King at all times for their administration;
and, as a security for their good management, they engaged to lend
the King no less than sixteen hundred millions of livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is the æra and beginning of all the confusion. From this
loan proceeded the downfal of the whole system.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>But before I proceed to explain the scheme of the Regent in these
operations upon credit, I think it will contribute to the clearing up
of the subject in general, to premise some short account of the rise
and progress of this great company of the Indies: and to give a
short abstract of some of the most memorable transactions during
the Missisippi scheme, in the order of time in which they followed
one another.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.27' class='c015'>CHAP. XXVII. <br /> <i>A short Account of the French Company of the Indies.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Cardinal de Richlieu, that great minister to Louis XIII. was
the first who established trading companies in France, anno 1628,
about the time of the siege of Rochelle.</p>

<p class='c001'>He then set on foot the companies of the West and East Indies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several others, viz. one for Canada, one for the Leeward Islands,
and another for Cayenne, were successively established in the beginning
of the reign of Louis XIV.</p>

<p class='c001'>These companies, before 1664, had frequently changed their
forms, and had succeeded very ill.</p>

<p class='c001'>At that time the great Colbert was in the administration of the
King’s affairs. He engaged his master to think seriously of establishing
the trade of his kingdom upon solid principles; for which
reason all the undertakers of the former projects of commerce to
the new world were reimbursed; and a new establishment was
made, called the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Compagnie des Indes Occidentales</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This exclusive trade comprehended that of Canada, the Caribbee
Islands, Acady, Newfoundland, Cayenne, the French continent of
America, from the river of the Amazons to that of Oronoko, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>coasts of Senegal, Goree, and other places in Africa; the whole for
40 years.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same year, 1664, there was another company formed for the
East Indies, of which we shall speak afterwards.</p>

<p class='c001'>The greatest encouragement was given to these new establishments.
Large sums were advanced by the King for several years,
without interest, and upon condition, that if, at the end of that
term, any loss was found on the trade, it should fall upon the money
due to the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>On examining into the West India company’s affairs, after ten
years administration, that is to say, in the year 1674, it was found,
that instead of profiting of their extensive privilege, by carrying on
a regular trade themselves, they had sold permissions to private
people to trade with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This abuse in the company had, however, inspired a taste for
trade among the French; which the King wishing to improve, he
reimbursed to the company all their expences, added their possessions
to his domain, and threw the trade open to his subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus ended the first company of the West Indies, called by the
French, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Compagnie d’Occident</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the suppression of this company, the French trade to America
was carried on and improved by private adventurers, some of
which obtained particular grants, to enable them to form colonies.
Of this number was Robert Chevalier de la Sale, a native of Rouen.
It was he who first discovered the river Missisippi, and who proposed
to the King, in 1683, to establish a colony there. He lost his life
in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hiberville, a Canadian, took up the project; but soon died. He
was succeeded by Antony Crozat, in 1712, who had better success;
but the death of the King in 1715, and the rising genius of Mr. Law,
engaged the Regent of France to make Crozat renounce his exclusive
privilege of trading. Upon which, by edict of the 6th of September
1717, was formed the second <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Compagnie d’Occident</i></span>, in favour
of Mr. Law: to which was added the fur trade of Canada, then in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>the hands of private adventurers, and the farm of the tobacco, for
which he paid 1,500,000 livres a year.</p>

<p class='c001'>I now come to the <a id='corr249.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='last'>East</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_249.3'><ins class='correction' title='last'>East</ins></a></span> India company.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have already mentioned the establishment of it by the great
Colbert in 1664.</p>

<p class='c001'>After his death, want of experience in those who succeeded him,
abuse of administration, carelesness in those who carried on the
company’s business, competition between different companies, and,
in short, every obstacle to new establishments, concurred with the
consequences of the long and expensive wars of Louis XIV. to render
all commercial projects ineffectual; and all the expence bestowed
in establishing those companies was in a manner lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1710, the merchants of St. Malo undertook the East India company.
It languished in their hands until 1719, and their importations
were not sufficient to supply the demand of France for India
goods: for this reason it was taken from them, and incorporated
with Mr. Law’s company of the West Indies, in May 1719.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this incorporation was established the great <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Company of the
Indies</i></span>, which still subsists in France: the only monument extant of
the famous and unfortunate Law.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the better understanding, therefore, what is to follow, let us
attend to some historical and chronological anecdotes, relative to
the wonderful operations of this Missisippi bank, and company of
the Indies. These I shall set down according to the order of time
in which they happened, that my reader may have recourse to them
as he goes along.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without the help of this table, I should be involved in a history
of those events, which however amusing it might be to some
readers, would be quite inconsistent with the nature of this inquiry.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c024'>These things premised, what follows will, I hope, be easily
understood.</p>

<p class='c001'>So soon as the Regent of France perceived the wonderful effects
produced by Mr. Law’s bank, he immediately resolved to make use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>of that engine, for clearing the King’s revenue of a part of the unsupportable
load of 80 millions of yearly interest, due, though indeed
very irregularly paid, to the creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was to compass this end, that he bestowed on Mr. Law the company
of the West Indies, and the farm of the tobacco.</p>

<p class='c001'>To absorb 100 millions of the most discredited articles of the
King’s debts, 200,000 actions or shares of this company were created.
These were rated at 500 livres each, and the subscription for the
actions was ordered to be paid in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>billets d’etat</i></span>, so much discredited
by reason of the bad payment of the interest, that 500 livres, nominal
value in these billets, would not have sold upon change for
above 160 or 170 livres. In the subscription they were taken
for the full value. As these actions became part of the company’s
stock, and as the interest of the billets was to be paid to them by
the King, this was effectually a loan from the company to the
King of 100 millions at 4 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The next step was to pay the interest regularly to the company.
Upon this the actions which had been bought for 170 livres, real
value, mounted to par, that is, to 500 livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was ascribed to the wonderful operations of the bank;
whereas it was wholly owing to the regular payment of the interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>In May following 1719, the East India company was incorporated
with the West India company: and the 200,000 actions formerly
created, were to be entitled to a common share of the profits of the
joint trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as the sale of the first actions had produced no liquid value
which could be turned into trade (having been paid for in state
billets) a new creation of 50,000 new actions was made in June
1719, and the subscription opened at 550 livres payable in effective
coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The confidence of the public in Mr. Law, was at this time so
great, that they might have sold for much more: but it was judged
expedient to limit the subscriptions to this sum; leaving the price
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of the actions to rise in the market, according to demand, in favour
of the original subscribers.</p>

<p class='c001'>This money amounting to 27 500 000 livres in coin, was to be
employed in building of ships, and other preparations for carrying
on the trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hopes of the public were so much raised by the favourable
appearance of a most lucrative trade, that more actions were
greedily demanded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly in a month after (July 1719) another creation was
made of 50,000 actions; and the price of them fixed at 1000 livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be observed, that all actions delivered by the company of
the Indies, originally contained an obligation on the company for
no more than 4 <i>per cent.</i> upon the value of <a id='corr254.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='5000'>500</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_254.13'><ins class='correction' title='5000'>500</ins></a></span> livres, with a proportion
of the profits on the trade; so that the rise of the actions proceeded
entirely from the hopes of those great profits, and from the
sinking of the rate of interest; a consequence of the plenty of money
to be lent.</p>

<p class='c001'>But besides the trade, what raised their value at this time, was,
that just before the last creation of actions, the King had made over
the mint to the company for a consideration of 50 millions of livres;
and this opened a new branch of profit to every one interested.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sale of the last coined actions taking place at 1000 livres each,
so great a rise seems to have engaged the Regent to extend his
views much farther than ever. To say that he foresaw what was
to happen, would be doing him the greatest injustice. He foresaw
it not, most certainly; for no man could foresee such complicated
events. But had he conducted himself upon solid principles; or by
the rules which, we now say, common honesty required, he certainly
never would have countenanced the subsequent operation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth creation of actions was in the beginning of September
1719.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the interval between the third and the fourth creation, the
Regent made over the general farms to the company, who paid
three millions and a half advanced rent for them. And the company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>obliged themselves to lend the King (including the 100 millions
already lent upon the first creation of actions) the immense
sum of 1600 millions at 3 <i>per cent.</i> that is, for 48 millions interest.
Now it is very plain, that before the month of September 1719, it
was impossible they could lend the King so great a sum.</p>

<p class='c001'>They had already lent him, in September 1718, 100 millions, by
taking the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>billets d’etat</i></span> for the subscription of the first creation of
actions; the second creation had produced coin, laid out in mercantile
preparations; and the third creation of actions, at the standard
value, was worth no more than 50 millions of livres: this was
their whole stock. Where then could they find 1500 millions more
to lend?</p>

<p class='c001'>I therefore conclude, that at this time, the combination which I
am now to unfold, must have, more or less, taken place between
the Regent and this great company.</p>

<p class='c001'>The public was abundantly imbibed with the notion of the prodigious
profits of the company, before they got possession of the
general farms. No sooner had they got that new source of riches
into their hands, than they promised a dividend of no less than 200
livres on every action, which was ten times more than was divided
on them when at first created.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence of this was, that (supposing the dividend permanent
and secure) an action <em>then</em> became as well worth 5000 livres
as at <em>first</em> it was worth 500 livres; accordingly to 5000 did it rise,
upon the promise of the new dividends.</p>

<p class='c001'>But what could be the motive of the company to promise this
dividend, only three months after their establishment? Surely, not
the profits upon a trade which was not as yet opened. Surely, not
the profits upon the King’s farms; for these profits it was greatly
their interest to conceal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their views lay deeper. The Regent perceived that the spirit of
the nation was too much inflamed, to suffer them to enter into an
examination of the wonderful phænomena arising from the establishment
of the bank, and company of the Indies. If the company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>promised 200 livres dividend, the public concluded that their
profits would enable them to pay it; and really in this particular
the public might be excused.</p>

<p class='c001'>The plan, therefore, concerted between the Regent and the company
seems to have been, to raise the actions to this great value,
in order to suspend a greater quantity of notes in circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was to be accomplished, 1. by the Regent’s purchasing the
actions himself from the company; 2. by borrowing back the notes
he had paid for them, in order to fill up the loan which the company
had agreed to make; 3. to pay off all the public creditors
with those notes so borrowed back; and 4. when the nation was
once filled with bank paper, to sell the actions he had purchased
from the company, to withdraw his own paper, and then destroy it.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this operation the whole debts of France were to be turned
into actions; and the company was to become the public debtor,
instead of the King, who would have no more to pay but 48 millions
of interest to the company.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this operation also, the Regent was to withdraw all the bank
notes which he had issued for no other value but for the payment
of debts; which notes were demandable at the bank; and for the
future, he was to issue no more (I suppose) but for value preserved.</p>

<h4 id='ch4.2.30' class='c015'>CHAP. XXX. <br /> <i>Inquiry into the Motives of the Duke of Orleans in concerting the Plan of the Missisippi.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Now if we examine the motives of the Regent, with regard to
this plan, and suppose that he foresaw all that was to happen
in consequence of it; and if we also suppose that he really believed
that the company never could be in a situation to make good the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>dividend of 200 livres, which they had promised upon their actions;
in a word, if we put the worst interpretation upon all his actions,
we must conclude that the whole was a most consummate piece of
knavery.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as this does not appear evidently, either by the succeeding
operations, or ultimate consequences of this scheme, I am loth to
ascribe, to that great man, a sentiment so opposite to that which
animated him, on his entrance upon the regency, when he nobly
rejected the plan proposed to him for expunging the debts altogether.</p>

<p class='c001'>I may therefore suppose, that he might believe that the company
to whom he had given the mint, the tobacco, the farms, and
the trade of France, and to whom he soon after gave the general
receipt of all the revenue, might by these means be enabled to
make good their engagements to the public. I say, this <em>may be supposed</em>;
in which case justice was to be done to every one; and the
King’s debts were to be reduced to 48 millions a year, instead of
80 millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>That this is a supposeable case, I gather from Dutot, who gives
us an enumeration of the revenue of the company, Vol. I. p. 162.

<p class='c001'>Now if we suppose the interest of money at 3 <i>per cent.</i> this sum
would answer to the capital of 2664 millions, which was more than
all the debts of the kingdom, for which they were to become answerable.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Upon this view of the matter, I say, <em>it was possible</em>, that the Regent
might form this plan, without any intention to defraud the
creditors; and more I do not pretend to affirm.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said that he purposely made the company raise the price
of their actions, in order to draw more notes into circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this it may be objected, that he might as well have paid off
the creditors with bank notes, without going this round-about way
to work; and have left them to purchase the actions directly from
the company.</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that such an operation would have appeared too bare-faced,
and might have endangered the credit of the bank. Whereas
in buying the actions, which were run upon by every body, the
state only appeared desirous of acquiring a share of the vast profits
to be made by the company. Farther,</p>

<p class='c001'>As the company appeared willing to accept of bank notes from
the state, in payment of their actions, this man&oelig;uvre gave an additional
credit, both to the actions, and to the notes; a thing very necessary
to be attended to, in a scheme which was calculated to bring
about a total transformation of the security for the King’s debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must however observe, that at the period concerning which we
are now talking, (viz. at the time the company promised the dividend
of 200 livres <i>per</i> action) the plan we have been describing
could not have been carried into execution.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were at that time only 400,000 actions created, rated at
777 millions: of these were disposed of at least 250,000, to wit, the
original 200,000; and the second creation of 50,000, sold for coin.
Besides, there were then only coined in bank notes for 520 millions.
So there was not a possibility of executing the plan I have mentioned,
as matters then stood.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is from the subsequent operations of the system, that it appears
evident that this and this only could be the intention.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall see how the number of actions were multiplied, without
any other view than to make the public imagine, that the funds necessary
for carrying on the trade of the company were immense.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>The number of the actions sold to the public was very inconsiderable,
compared with those sold to the Regent, and found in
his hands at the blowing up of the system.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, at the period when the number of actions was carried
to the utmost, viz. to 624,000, the bank notes bore no proportion
to their value; for, on the 4th of October 1719, when the last creation
of actions was made, the bank notes did not exceed the sum
above specified, to wit, 520 millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in tracing the progress of the system upon the table, we
perceive, that after the actions were once carried to their full number,
(October 4th, 1719) then the coining of bank notes began
at a most prodigious rate; in so much, that by the month of May
1720, they were increased from 520 millions, to above 2696 millions;
and all this sum, except 461 millions, were found in circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther: We shall see, that when the Regent and the company
made out their accompts, there were found in the Regent’s hands
no less than 400,000 actions, which were burnt; and 25 millions
of interest upon the sum of money due by the King to the company,
extinguished.</p>

<p class='c001'>These facts prove beyond a doubt, that these 400,000 actions had
been bought with the notes coined posterior to the 4th of October
1719; otherwise the actions could not have become the property
of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, it was acknowleged publicly, that the notes were coined
for that purpose. (See Dutot, Vol. I. p. 144.) In the next place,
it is evident, that the notes which had been given in payment for
those actions, had been borrowed back, to fill up the loan of 1600
millions of livres; which the company never could have otherwise
lent to the King. And in the last place, it is certain that the
public debts were paid off with these notes, so borrowed back
from the company: because we shall find the notes in circulation
at the blowing up of the system, in May 1720; and we shall see
how they were paid and withdrawn in October following.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>This detail I own is a little long, and perhaps too minute: but I
thought it necessary to prove the solidity of my conjectures concerning
the Regent’s motives in concerting this plan; which no
French author, that ever I saw, has pretended to unfold, except by
hints too dark to be easily comprehended.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is now to follow, will still set my conjectures in a fairer
light. We have seen already from the table, with what rapidity
the creation of actions went on from the 13th of September to the
4th of October 1719. No less than 324,000 were created in that
interval.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet Dutot, vol. ii. p. 169, <i>et seq.</i> positively says, that on the 4th
of October, the company had not sold for more than 182,500,000
livres of their actions. Now the total value, as they were rated
when created, extended to 1,797,500,000; so there was little more
than one tenth part of the value sold off.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why therefore create such immense quantities of actions, and
so far beyond the demand for them, but to throw dust in the eyes
of the public; to keep up the spirit of infatuation; and to pave
the way for the final execution of the plan?</p>

<p class='c001'>The actions being brought, by four successive creations, of the
13th and 28th of September, the 2d and 4th of October, to their
full number, the company, during that interval, obtained the general
receipt of the whole revenue. Thus, says Dutot, vol. ii.
p. 197. the company was intrusted with the whole revenue, debts
and expences of the state, and all unnecessary charge was avoided
in collecting and administring it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the month of November 1719, the credit of the bank, and of
the company, was so great, that the actions rose to 10,000 livres.
Notwithstanding, says Dutot, vol. ii. p. 198. that the company did
what they could to keep down the price, by throwing into the market,
in one week, for no less than 30 millions. He assigns seven
different reasons for this, which, all put together, are not worth
one; to wit, that the Regent was ready to buy up every one that
lay upon hand, in concert with the company.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>If the company had been inclined to keep down the price of the
actions, they had nothing more to do than to deliver part of the
vast number they still had unsold, at the standard value of 5000
livres, at which they were rated when created; and this would
have effectually prevented their rising to 10,000 livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it was the interest of the Regent, who was at that time well
provided with actions, to stock-job, and to buy with one hand,
while he was selling with the other: these operations were then
as well known in the street called Quinquempoix, as now in Change-alley.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a proof of the justness of my allegation, that the Regent was
doing all he could to raise the price of the actions, Dutot informs
us, in the place above cited, that the bank, at this very time, was
lending money, upon the security of actions, at 2 <i>per cent.</i> If that
was <a id='corr261.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='he'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_261.15'><ins class='correction' title='he'>the</ins></a></span> case, how was it possible that an action, with 200 livres dividend,
should sell for less than 10,000 livres, which is the capital corresponding
to 200 livres, at 2 <i>per cent.</i>?</p>

<p class='c001'>This is evident; and were it necessary, it may be proved to demonstration,
that the rise of the actions was the consequence of a
political combination.</p>

<p class='c001'>But <em>if</em> money, at that time, came to bear no more than 2 <i>per cent.</i>
and if the company was able to afford 200 livres upon the action;
where was the inequity of raising the actions to 10,000 livres? I confess
I can see none, nor do I perceive either the impossibility or
improbability of the two postulata, had matters been rightly conducted.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to money’s falling to 2 <i>per cent.</i> any man of 20 years old may
expect to see it, without a <em>Mississippi</em>: and as for the payment of the
dividends, there never were in the hands of the public, nor ever
could be, had all the creditors of the 2000 millions of public debts
invested in actions at 10,000 a-piece, one half of 624,000 actions
disposed of: consequently, the 200 livres dividend would not have
amounted, upon 312,000 actions, to more than 62,400,000 livres;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>and the revenue of the company, as we have seen, exceeded 80
millions a year.</p>

<p class='c001'>This still tends to vindicate the Regent from the gross imputation
of fraud, in the conduct of the Missisippi.</p>

<p class='c001'>But what should still more exculpate that prince, in the eyes of
every impartial man who examines the whole conduct of the affair,
is the uniform sentiments of the most intelligent men in
France concerning the doctrine of money and credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we find Dutot, who wrote against the arbitrary change
of the coin; and De Melon, the Regent’s man of confidence and
secretary, who wrote for it, two persons considered in France
as most able financiers, both agreeing, that during the operations
of the system, money never was to be considered but according to
denominations; that there was nothing against good policy in
changing the value of these denominations; and that paper-money,
whether issued for value, or for no value, or for the payment
of debts, was always good, <em>providing there was coin enough in
France</em> for the changing of it, although that coin did not belong to
the debtors in the paper; when these principles, I say, were
adopted by the men of penetration in France; when we find them
published in their writings, many years after the Regent’s death,
as maxims of what they call their <em>credit public</em>; I think it would be
the highest injustice to load the Duke of Orleans with the gross imputation
of knavery, in the Missisippi scheme.</p>

<p class='c001'>Law no doubt saw its tendency. But Law saw also, that credit
supported itself on those occasions, where it stood on the most
ticklish bottom: he saw bank notes to the amount of more than
two thousand millions, issued in payment of the King’s debts,
without occasioning any run upon the bank, or without suggesting
an idea to the public that the bank should naturally have had some
fund, to make them good: he saw people, who were in possession
of a value in paper exceeding 6000 millions of livres, 60 to the
marc, (Dutot, vol. i. p. 144.) look calm and unconcerned, when,
in one day, the coin was raised in its denomination to 80 livres in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the marc; by which operation, the 6000 millions of the day before
lost 25 <i>per cent.</i> of their real value. He saw that this operation did
not in the least affect the credit of the bank paper; because people
minded nothing but denominations.</p>

<p class='c001'>He saw farther, that by the operation proposed, the whole debt of
the King would be transferred upon the company. He saw that these
debts, being turned into bank notes, would not be sufficient to buy
above 200,000 actions, at the value they then sold for. He knew that
the Regent, who had bought 400,000 of these actions at 5000 livres
apiece, that is, at half price, would remain in possession of 200,000
actions, after selling enough to draw back the whole of the bank
notes issued for the payment of the debts; and he saw that the company
of the Indies had a yearly income of above 80 millions to enable
them to make good their engagements: besides, he saw a power
in the King to raise the denominations of the coin at will, without
shocking the ideas of his people, by which means he might have
paid the 2000 millions with one louis d’or. Put all these circumstances
together, and I can imagine that Law’s brain was turned;
that he had lost sight of all his principles; and that he might believe
that his former common sense, was, at that time, become
absolute nonsense <em>in France</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>That common sense may become nonsense, is a thing by no
means peculiar to France, but quite peculiar to <em>man</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall offer but one argument more, to prove that the Duke of
Orleans, and Law, could have no premeditated design of defrauding
the public, by these wonderful operations; which is, that
admitting the contrary, would be allowing them an infinite superiority
of understanding over all the rest of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>Until the bubble burst, no body <em>could</em> know where it was to
end: every thing appeared very extraordinary indeed; and the
fatal catastrophe might have been expected from the greatness of
the undertaking, merely. But if there had been any roguery in
the plan itself, it must have appeared palpable long before; because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the whole of the operations in which only <em>it could</em> consist,
were public.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the notes were created by public act of council; so were the
actions: the loan of 1600 millions to the King, by the company,
was a public deed; so was the alienation in their favour, of 48 millions
for the interest of that sum. Notes were avowedly coined in
order to purchase actions, (Dutot, Vol. I. p. 144.) the creditors were
avowedly paid with bank notes, at a time when it was forbid to
have 500 livres in coin in any person’s custody; consequently, it
was also forbid to demand coin for bank notes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now all this was going on in the months of February, March,
April, and the beginning of May 1720; and no suspicion of any
failure of credit. The coin also was sometimes raised, sometimes
diminished in its value, and still the fabric stood firm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under these circumstances, to say there was knavery, is to say
that all the world were absolutely blockheads, except the Regent
and John Law: and to that opinion I never can subscribe.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may seem surprising that I should take so much pains to vindicate
the two principal conductors of that scheme. My intention is
not so much to do justice to their reputation, which has been grossly
calumniated by many, who have written the history of those times,
as to prove, that an ill concerted system of credit may bring ruin
on a nation, although fraud be out of the question: and if a nation
be plunged into all the calamities which a public bankruptcy can
occasion, it is but a small consolation to be assured of the good intentions
of those who were the cause of it.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.2.31' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXI. <br /> <i>Continuation of the Account of the royal Bank of France, until the total Bankruptcy on the 21st of May 1720.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I now resume the thread of my story. We left off at that period
when the credit of the company and of the bank was in all its
glory, (November 1719) the actions selling at 10,000 livres; dividend
200 livres a year <i>per</i> action; and the bank lending at 2 <i>per
cent.</i>: all this was quite consistent with the then rate of money.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this state did matters continue until the 22d of February 1720,
when the bank was incorporated with the company of the Indies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The King still continued guarantee of all the bank notes, none
were to be coined but by his authority: and the controller-general
for the time being, was to have, at all times, with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Prevot des
marchands</i></span> of Paris, ready access to inspect the books of the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the intention, at the time of the incorporation, was to coin a
very great quantity of notes, in order to buy up the actions; and
to borrow back the money, in order to pay off the creditors; it was
proper to gather together as much coin as possible, to guard against
a run upon the bank: for which purpose the famous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Arret de Conseil</i></span>,
of the 27th of February 1720, was published, forbidding any person
to keep by them more than 500 livres in coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was plainly annulling the obligation in the bank paper, <em>to
pay to the bearer on demand the sum specified, in silver coin</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Was it not very natural, that such an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> should have, at once,
put an end to the credit of the bank. No such thing however happened.
The credit remained solid after this as before; and no body
minded gold or silver any more than if the denomination in their
paper had had no relation to those metals. Accordingly, many, who
had coin and confidence, brought it in, and were glad to get paper
for it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>The coin being collected in about a week’s time, another <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Arret de
Conseil</i></span>, of the 5th of March, was issued, raising the denomination
from 60 livres to 80 livres the marc. Thus, I suppose, the coin
which the week before had been taken in at 60 livres, was paid
away at 80: and the bank gained 33⅓ <i>per cent.</i> upon this operation.
Did this hurt the credit of the bank paper? Not in the least.</p>

<p class='c001'>So soon as the coin was paid away, which was not a long operation,
for it was over in less than a week; another <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Arret de Conseil</i></span>,
of the 11th of the same month of March, came out, declaring that,
by the first of April, the coin was to be again reduced to 70 livres
the marc, and on the first of May to 65 livres. Upon this, the coin,
which had been paid away the week before, came pouring into the
bank, for fear of the diminution which was to take place the first
of April. In this period of about three weeks, the bank received
about 44 millions of livres; and those who brought it in thought
they were well rid of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was during the months of February, March, and April 1720,
that the great operations of the system were carried on.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may see by the chronological anecdotes in the 36th chapter,
what prodigious sums of bank notes were coined, and issued during
that time. It was during this period also, that a final conclusion was
put to the reimbursing all the public creditors with bank notes: in
consequence of which payment, the former securities granted to
them by the King, under the authority of the parliament of Paris,
were withdrawn and annulled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here then we have conducted this scheme to the last period.</p>

<p class='c001'>There remained only one step to be made to conclude the operation;
to wit, the sale of the actions, which the Regent had in his
custody to the number of 400,000.</p>

<p class='c001'>These were to be sold to the public, who were at this time in possession
of bank notes to the value of 2 235 083 590 livres. See the
foregoing table.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had the sale of the actions taken place, the notes would all have
returned to the bank, and there have been destroyed: by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>operation, the company would have become debtor to the public
for the dividends of all the actions in <em>their</em> hands, and to the King
for all those which might have remained in the hands of the Regent.
These proportions we cannot bring to any calculation, as it would
have depended entirely on the price of the actions during so great
an operation; and on the private conventions between the parties,
the Regent and the company.</p>

<p class='c001'>But alas! all this is a vain speculation. The system which hitherto
had stood its ground in spite of the most violent shocks, was now to
tumble into ruin from a childish whim.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to set this stroke of political arithmetic in the most ludicrous
light possible, I must do it in Dutot’s own words, uttered with
a sore heart and in sober sadness.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had said before, that the coin of France was equal to 1200
millions of livres at 60 livres the marc. This marc was now at 65
livres (in May 1720, as above) so the <em>numerary</em> value, as he calls it,
(that is the denomination) of the coin was now risen to 1 300 000 000;
but the bank notes circulating in the month of May were carried
to 2 696 400 000; then he adds,</p>

<p class='c001'>"The 1300 millions of coin <em>which were in France</em>, were very far
from 2696 millions of notes. In that case, the sum of notes was
to the sum of coin, nearly as 2<sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>27</sub> are to 1; that is to say, that 207
livres 8 sols 1⅞ denier in notes, was only worth 100 livres in coin;
or otherwise, that a bank note of 100 livres, was only worth 48
livres 4 sols 5 deniers in coin, or thereabouts." Would not any
mortal conclude from this, that the whole sum of 1300 millions had
been in the bank, as the only fund for the payment of the paper?</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a laboured equation, and from it we have a specimen of
this gentleman’s method of calculating the value of bank paper:
but let us hear him out.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This prodigious quantity of money in circulation, says he, had
raised the price of every thing excessively: so in order to bring
down prices, it was judged more expedient to diminish the denomination
of the bank notes, than to raise the denomination of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the coin; because <em>that</em> diminished the quantity of money, <em>this</em>
augmented it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was the grand point put under deliberation, before the famous
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 21st of May was given, viz. whether to raise the
value of the coin, <em>which did not belong to the bank, but to the French
nation</em>, to double the denomination it bore at that time, that is, to
130 livres the marc, by which means the 1300 millions would
have made 2600 millions, or to reduce the 2600 millions of bank
notes to one half, that is, to 1300 millions, the total denomination
of the coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>To some people it would have appeared more proper, to allow matters
to stand as they were, as long as they would stand, at least until
the actions had been all sold off; but this was not thought proper.
After a most learned deliberation, it was concluded to reduce the
denomination of all the paper of France, bank notes as well as
actions, instead of raising the denomination of the coin; and this
because prices were in proportion to the quantity of the denominations
of money.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> was no sooner published than the whole paper fabric
fell to nothing. The day following, the 22d of May, a man might
have starved with a hundred millions of paper in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was a catastrophe the like of which, I believe, never happened:
it is so ridiculous that it is a subject fit only for a farce.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here Dutot’s lamentations and regrets are inimitable.</p>

<p class='c001'>In one place he says, “Credit was too far stretched to be solid. It
was therefore proper to sacrifice one part, to give a solidity to the
other. Even this was done; but the consequences did not correspond
to the intention. Confidence, which is the soul of credit,
eclipsed itself, and the loss of the bank note, drew on the loss of
the action.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In another place he says, “This <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 21st of May, which according
to some <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>blessoit l’equité</i></span>” (a very mild expression!) “destroyed
all confidence in the public; because the King had diminished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>one half of that paper money (the bank notes) which had been
declared fixed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not a thousand pities that confidence should have disappeared
upon so slight a wound given to equity, only in the opinion of
some? For Dutot thought the operation perfectly consistent with the
principles of public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>He tells us, that a letter was writ to calm the minds of the
people, and to shew them how absurd it was, to allow the paper to
be fixed, while the coin varied: but, says he, “as there was a revenue
attached to the action, the value of that paper did not depend
so much upon the capital, as on the sum of the interest.” Very
just. But were the dividends to stand at 200 livres, without suffering
the same diminution as the action? And how was confidence to
subsist in a country, where the denominations of both the paper
and the coin were at the disposal of a minister?</p>

<p class='c001'>The diminution upon the paper, by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 21st of May,
raised a most terrible clamour; and Law became the execration of
France, instead of being considered as its saviour. He was banished,
and reduced to beggary the same day.</p>

<p class='c001'>What profit could either the Regent, or Law, have reaped from the
success of such an operation? Had the coin been raised to 130 livres
the marc, no hurt would probably have ensued, and the same effect
would have been produced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had matters been left without any change at all, no bad consequences
would have followed: these existed only in the heads of
the French theorists. There was, indeed, twice as much money in
bank notes as in coin, in the whole kingdom of France: and what
then?</p>

<p class='c001'>When the Regent saw the fatal effects of his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 21st
of May, he revoked it on the 27th of the same month. On the
29th, he raised the coin to 82 livres 10 sols in the marc, and re-established
all the paper at its former denomination: but, as Dutot
has said, confidence was gone, and was no more to be recalled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Nothing surprises me, but that she lived so long under such rough
management.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dutot, in talking of this augmentation of the coin, on the 29th of
May, to 82 livres 10 sols, says, “This operation was consistent with
the principles of public credit, and advantageous. They would
have done better had they pushed the augmentation to 135 livres
the marc; which would have made the specie of France equal
to the sum of bank notes.” These are his words, p. 165.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are not these very sensible principles, coming from a man who
has writ a book, which indeed few people can understand, in order
to prove the great hurt of tampering with the coin of France?</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.32' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXII. <br /> <i>Conclusion of the Missisippi Scheme.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>The Regent, persuaded that the blunder of the 21st of May was
absolutely irreparable, fell to work next to clear accompts
with the company.</p>

<p class='c001'>He owed them 1600 millions capital, and 48 millions a year of
interest upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, he had in his possession no less than 400,000
actions, which at 200 livres dividend, which the company was
obliged to pay, amounted to 80 millions a year.</p>

<p class='c001'>How the Regent and the company settled matters, I do not know
precisely. This, however, is certain, that by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 3d of
June 1720, the number of 400 000 actions, belonging to the Regent,
were burnt; and 24 000 more which had been created by his particular
order, the 4th of October 1719, and never delivered to the
company, were suppressed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>On the other hand, the company ceded 25 millions a year, of the
48 millions which had been transferred to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>That sum was constituted anew upon the town-house of Paris, as
a fund to be subscribed for by the proprietors of bank notes, at
the rate of 2½ <i>per cent.</i> or as the French call it at the 40th penny.
(Dutot, p. 168.) In consequence of this, 530 millions of bank notes
were subscribed for, and paid in, in the month of June 1720.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the destruction of the 400,000 actions, the credit of the bank
notes languished until the 10th of October 1720.</p>

<p class='c001'>The object for which they were created was now gone. The
whole scheme of transferring the King’s debts upon the company
vanished in the conflagration of the actions. What was then to be
done?</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank was at an end: 2235 millions of discredited bank notes
in circulation, and a small sum of coin to make them good, was a
situation which no authority could long support.</p>

<p class='c001'>The resolution then was taken to put a final conclusion to this
great affair; to bid a long farewel to credit and confidence; and to
return upon the old system of rents upon the town-house of Paris;
and of coming at money in the best way they could.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall now see how this was accomplished; and from that
form a pretty good guess at the extent of the fraud committed, with
respect to the creditors of France; not so much, I think, from any
intrinsic defect in the Missisippi scheme, as from the distress the nation
was thrown into, by the ignorance of those who over-ruled
John Law in conducting it.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how the actions were reduced to the number of
200,000; we must now give an account of the deplorable fate of the
bank notes.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of 10th of October 1720, all bank notes were entirely
suppressed; and it was declared, that after the 1st of December following,
they were to have no course whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here follows the arrangement of this great affair, viz. the liquidation
of 2 696 400 000 livres of bank notes as regulated by this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is (as near as I can guess at it) the state of the French bankruptcy
in 1720.</p>

<p class='c001'>The creditors were <em>robbed</em> of 23 millions a year. I call it <em>robbed</em>,
because the interest due to them was diminished by that sum, without
their consent, and in consequence of the most arbitrary proceedings;
whereas, had the system been conducted with ability,
the whole of the debts would have been brought to an interest of
48 millions, instead of 57, and no body would have complained of
injustice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Money likewise might have been brought to 2 <i>per cent.</i> The
1600 millions borrowed of the company at 3 <i>per cent.</i> would then
have been reduced to two; which would have brought the 48 millions
of interest, upon the whole, to 32 millions: and France, from
being reduced to beggary by the King’s wars, would have become
the most flourishing state in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is not so much facts as principles, I have been investigating
through this whole disquisition; and the imperfect account I have
been able to give of the <em>former</em>, will at least point out, I hope, the
notions which the French nation, at that time, had of the <em>latter</em>. If
the contrast between French principles, and those I have laid down,
tend to cast any light upon the subject of paper credit in general,
my end is accomplished: if they ever prove of use to mankind, I
shall not think my labour lost.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.33' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXIII. <br /> <i>Why Credit fell, and how it might have been supported.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>I shall now make a few general observations upon the total
and sudden fall of credit in France in May 1720: and I shall
suggest the means by which, I think, it might have been sustained,
even after all the preceeding mismanagement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Was it any wonder that the French should be astonished at this
prodigious revolution, at this immense value of paper on the 21st
of May, and at the total discredit of every bit of it the day following?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>If there was a value, said they, what is become of it? If there
never was any value, how could a nation be so deceived? This
phænomenon has puzzled many a head; but the nature and principles
of credit furnish an easy solution of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In deducing the principles of credit, we have shewn <em>that a permanent
and well secured fund of interest is always equal in value to a corresponding
capital</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference between a <em>permanent</em> and <em>well secured fund</em>, and a
<em>precarious</em> and <em>ill secured fund</em>, consists in this, that the first never can
disappear, and the other may.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the fund, in this case, was at first <em>real</em> and did exist; but it
was rendred precarious, by a blundering administration: then
credit failed, and in that convulsion, the fund of interest was fraudulently
diminished by an act of power.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had the true principles of credit been understood in France, the
bank notes and actions might have been supported, even after the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 21st of May: and all the monstrous value of paper,
raised so high by the low rate of interest, might have been preserved:
consequently that value, in capital, <em>really existed</em> relatively to
the rate of interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the object of the present disquisition into the principles upon
which the Missisippi scheme was conducted, is only intended as an
illustration of the principles of credit in general; I shall first account
for the wonderful phænomenon above mentioned, and then shew
how, in the greatest of all the French distress, their credit might
have been re-established in a more solid manner than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the wonderful phænomenon of the prodigious <em>wealth</em> created
by the system, and annihilated in one day, I answer, that there
had been no creation of wealth at all, except in consequence of the
fall of interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, We have seen that at the death of the late King of France,
the interest of his debts amounted to 80 millions. Was not this a
fund which ought to have been made solid and permanent? Will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>any man say, that a regular plan of paying this interest was a
means of creating new wealth? Certainly not.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, These debts were secured by <em>contracts of constitution of annual
rents upon the town-house of Paris</em>: a security taken in the name
of a particular creditor, which requires a form of law to
transfer.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the scheme we have been explaining, all these securities were
changed: and instead of constitutions of rent, bank notes, in which
the King was equally debtor, were given.</p>

<p class='c001'>Will any man say, that this was the means of either increasing or
diminishing the wealth of France? Certainly not. A man who has
a good bond in his pocket is as rich before it is paid with bank
notes as after: but he has not so much money in his hands; because
the bond is not <em>money</em>, and the notes are.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, We have said that the interest of the King’s debts amounted
to 80 millions a year, at 4 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how the company of the Indies were provided with
a fund equal to this sum, arising from the 48 millions which the
King paid for the loan of the paper with which the debts were to
be paid, and from many other lucrative branches of revenue;
which instead of being burthensome to the King, were, on the
contrary, a means of augmenting his income, by the advanced
rent the company gave for the different farms which produced
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had the public creditors, therefore, vested their claims in actions,
they would, in consequence of that operation, have become sharers
in the fund of 80 millions a year, administred by themselves, (and
they would then have been the company) open to be improved by
trade abroad, and by a good administration at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had this system been carried on in a plain easy way, consistently
with common sense, the public creditors would have been paid;
the King’s revenue augmented; and it would have been put under
a good and a cheap administration.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>But when, by the absurd operations of changing the denominations
of coin and paper, and wantonly playing with every man’s
property, the creditors saw themselves standing on the brink of a
precipice; and finding, instead of a good contract on the town-house
of Paris, a bank note put into their hands, which might be
diminished in its value by one half every month, while at the same
time the coin might be raised to double, it was very natural to suppose,
that the intention of the King’s ministers was to withdraw
from them totally these 80 millions, less or more, to which they
were entitled: in which case, there was an annihilation indeed of
all the notes; but there was no annihilation of wealth: for in that
case, the wealth was still the same, only it was transferred from
the creditors to the King the debtor: that is, the creditors were
defrauded.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, stood the proprietors of the actions sold. These
were in use to make a traffic of buying and selling the 200,000 actions
which had been in their hands ever since September 1717,
when they were first created. For we have shewn, that the posterior
creation of actions by the united company, was a mere delusion,
as they were all found in the custody of the Regent. The actions,
I say, were immediately put into a state of stagnation; because of
the discredit cast upon the bank notes, with which it had been usual
to buy them.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, I must observe, that the stagnation of a paper which carries
no interest, is equal to a temporary annihilation. The holder then
is deprived of the use of his money; and he is not paid for the loss
he sustains.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, it had been possible to have given a new activity to
this bank paper, without allowing it to die away, as it were, in
this temporary fit of fainting, credit would have revived: all accompts
would have been kept clear, for this is the use of paper
money, and so short a shock would hardly have been felt.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the great damage resulting to the public, upon every occasion
of this kind, proceeds from the <em>delay</em> in applying the proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>remedy. When any paper is discredited, it immediately falls in its
value. The person then who is the original and real creditor for
the whole value, and in whose hands the paper is when it suffers
the discredit, sells at discount: this is an irretrievable loss to him;
and when the paper recovers its credit again, either in part, or on the
whole, the profit then belongs to the person who had bought it at
discount, and does not go to indemnify the real sufferer.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was the case with respect to the notes of the French bank:
they were allowed to languish from the 21st of May that they were
discredited, until the 10th of October, when their fate was decided,
as has been said.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther, we have seen, that this whole movement of credit had
for its basis 80 millions a year, originally paid to the creditors for
their interest. This sum answered to the capital of 2000 millions;
because at the old King’s death, interest was fixed at 4 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>When, by the operations of the system, all this capital was turned
into money, that is, bank notes, the regorging plenty of it made
interest fall to 2 <i>per cent.</i> consequently, the capital, which constantly
draws its value from the interest paid for it, rose to 4000 millions.
We have said that the total value of the paper rose to 6000 millions;
but we must reflect, that above 2000 millions of these 6000 millions
was in bank notes, and employed in buying of actions. So that
both the notes and the actions must not be reckoned as existing
together.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had the Regent sold the actions, he would have burnt 2000 millions
of bank notes, and thus the value in paper would have remained
at 4000 millions, so long as interest remained at 2 <i>per
cent.</i>; and had interest fallen still lower, and dividends remained at
200 livres <i>per</i> action, the value of actions, and consequently of this
capital of 4000 millions, would have risen in proportion, just as the
value of the capital of the debts of Great Britain rises and falls according
to the rate of money; although the same sum of interest
be paid to the creditors at all times.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>This augmentation, therefore, upon the value of all capitals,
during the Missisippi, of lands as well as actions, was in consequence
of the fall of interest, and from no other artifice whatever. Lands
in France, at that time, sold at 80 and 100 years purchase. [Dutot,
Vol. II. p. 200.]</p>

<p class='c001'>When credit failed, and when all the circulating paper was
thrown into a state of stagnation, interest rose, in proportion to the
deficiency of the supply for the demands of borrowers. The value
of capitals then diminished. But this might have happened from
another cause, had there been no bankruptcy, or intention to defraud
the creditors: a war might have produced it; or any circumstance
which might have raised the rate of interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rise, therefore, upon capitals, from the fall of interest, I consider
here as no acquisition of wealth: I reckon wealth to be that
which is the annual produce of the capitals.</p>

<p class='c001'>So much for the resolution of this wonderful phænomenon.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must now shew that in the height of the distress, the confidence
of the public was still to be regained, and credit recovered, even
after the fatal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 21st of May 1720.</p>

<p class='c001'>I lay it down as a principle, <em>that whoever has a sufficient fund, and
pays interest regularly for the money he owes, runs no risk of losing his credit</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>So soon, therefore, as the Regent found that by his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the
21st of May, all credit had disappeared; had he, upon the 27th of
the same month, or at the time he raised the coin to 82 livres 10 sols
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>per</i></span> marc, ordered all bank notes presented to the bank, either to
be paid in coin, or marked in the books of the bank as bearing
interest at 2 <i>per cent.</i> I say, credit would not have suffered in any
comparison to what it did. No body then would have sold a note at
discount; and had it been necessary, he might have ordered the interest to be paid monthly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The authority I have for this opinion is Dutot, who says, that
upon opening the subscription of 25 millions in the month of June,
the notes fell in their value 11½ <i>per cent.</i> only.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Now the rate of this subscription was at 2½ <i>per cent.</i> as we have
seen; consequently, if 100 livres of notes lost but 11½ <i>per cent.</i> they
were worth 88½ livres in coin; but these 100 livres in notes were
worth 2½ <i>per cent.</i> because the subscription was open at that rate:
consequently 88½ livres in coin was also worth 2 livres 10 sols <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per
annum</i></span>: consequently interest, at that time, was at 2.825 <i>per cent.</i>
that is, below 3 <i>per cent.</i> even after the bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where then was the great harm? Where was the occasion to fly
immediately to the destruction of actions, which were in the Regent’s
own hand? A little patience, and good management, would
have set all to rights.</p>

<p class='c001'>I would, therefore, have left the notes in circulation under this
regulation, viz. that such as should be presented to the bank should
have had a transfer of 2 <i>per cent.</i> paid quarterly; or a value, in
actions, at 10,000 livres <i>per</i> action; which is the capital answering
a dividend of 200 livres at 2 <i>per cent.</i> at the option of the holder: and
in case interest had come to fall still lower, the price of actions
might have been augmented.</p>

<p class='c001'>I would have set before the public a full and exact account of the
company’s funds. I would have banished all mystery from the
affairs of credit. I would have registred a declaration in parliament,
setting forth,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, That all future changes either upon the denominations of
paper or coin, were contrary to the maxims of good government.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, That all stipulations between the King and his creditors were
to be inviolable. And,</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, That the parliament of Paris should for ever remain invested
with an exclusive right to watch over those regulations in time to
come; and I would have bound the parliament by a special oath
for that purpose. I would even have had the King to take the same
oath: and he might have ratified it at his coronation in 1725.</p>

<p class='c001'>By these steps I should have vested a new power in the Kings of
France which they never had before: a power of having money
from their subjects, from their allies, and from their enemies: a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>power they have not, nor ever will have, until the principles of
credit be better understood among them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had such a plan been followed, I have not the least doubt, but
that, 1. The actions would have been sold at a very great advanced
value above the standard of 5000 livres, at which the Regent had
bought them: 2. That money would have come back to 2 <i>per cent.</i>
and then, 3. Had banks been established upon a proper plan, ease,
with industry, would long ere now have appeared in every corner
of that kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>How infinitely more easy would it have been to establish such a
plan in 1720 than at present? At that time the most difficult part of
the whole was executed. The creditors had taken notes for their
claims: the credit then was given. There was nothing to be done
but to support it. The creditors were then at the mercy of the
state: at present the state is at the mercy of the creditors. Were
such operations on coin to take place at present, as were then familiar;
were the King at present to attempt to turn the constitutions
of rent, perpetual and life-annuities, into any other form than
what they have, the credit of France would be undone for a long
time; and who knows what views of ambition a situation so deplorable
might not stir up in certain courts of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>What state would pay its debts, if it <em>durst</em> do otherwise? And
what state can diminish its debts in any other way than by lowering
the interest upon them? But of this more in the proper place.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.2.34' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXIV. <br /> <i>How the diminishing the Denomination of the Paper in Circulation, by the arret of the 21st of May 1720, destroyed the Credit of France, when the same arbitrary Measures taken, with regard to the Coin, had produced no such Effect.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This question is curious, and I shall endeavour to resolve it in
the best way I can, before I conclude this subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first thing to be done is to point out the immediate effects
which resulted upon diminishing the denomination of the paper;
because the destruction of the credit of France was not the immediate
consequence of this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span>; but the ultimate effect of a chain
of consequences which followed indeed very quick upon one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>The paper had been declared, against the opinion of Mr. Law, by
an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Arret de Conseil</i></span> of the 22d of April 1719, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>une monnoie fixe</i></span>, as has
been said. Consequently, any diminution of its denomination was
a plain infraction of the public faith. From this declaration in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 22d of April 1719, the public reaped one notable advantage,
which was, that in borrowing and lending paper, every one
was sure that the obligations contracted could be dissolved by restoring
the very same species of property which had been received;
but by diminishing the denomination of it, by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of the 21st
of May 1720, all such as were debtors, became obliged to discharge
their debts at the expence of double the sum of paper borrowed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The immediate consequence, therefore, of touching the denomination
of the paper, was, to shew the public that their fortunes in
paper were liable to the same inconveniences as fortunes in specie;
that is, that they might be increased or diminished at pleasure.
Upon this it was very natural for every one to endeavour to realize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>his paper, and put it into coin: since, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in pari casu</i></span>, it was better to
have it in that which had some intrinsic value, than in that which
had none at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all the French paper, the notes were the most easily realized;
because there was contained in them a direct obligation upon the
bank to pay them in coin. The actions again were more difficult
to be converted; because in order to realize them, it was necessary
to find people who were willing to give either notes or coin for
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>A run upon the bank, therefore, taking place, upon the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> of
the 21st of May, it was obliged to stop payment: this occasioned a
general alarm, and <em>destroyed the confidence which the public had had in
the state</em>, which is what we mean by <em>public credit</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This point explained, it remains to shew why the augmentations
and diminutions upon the specie should not have ruined the credit
of the paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The operations upon the specie affected the paper only indirectly;
but the diminution upon the paper affected it directly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The operations upon the specie only affected that part of the paper
which was made to circulate as an equivalent for the specie; or in
other words, that part which people realized, either, 1. with an
intention to withdraw their funds altogether out of the scheme;
or 2. to profit of the operations upon the specie; or in the last place,
to procure small sums of money for common expences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now as to the first, the number of those who wished to withdraw
their stocks were inconsiderable, in proportion to the stock-jobbers;
and therefore their interest could not affect the general credit; and
the last was inconsiderable in every respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the second, the government made it very difficult for the
proprietors of notes to profit of the operations upon the coin. When
it was to be diminished, the diminutions were advertised some time
before they took place, and the diminution went on always by degrees.
Thus people who had paper, with which they could trade
in buying actions, constantly rising in their value, by the intrigues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of the state, when at the same time the denominations of the coin
were diminishing, did not carry their notes to the bank for two
reasons.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first, that the paper really gained by every diminution upon
the denomination of the specie, in an exact proportion to the diminution.
A livre in a bank note, while the specie was diminishing
by intervals from 80 livres the marc to 65 the marc, gained regularly
in the hands of the possessor; whereas had he realized at any
period but the last, the subsequent diminutions upon the specie he
had acquired with his paper would have affected the value of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second was, that by realizing he deprived himself of the
profit of stock-jobbing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only way, therefore, for the proprietors of the paper to gain
by the operations of the state upon the coin, was to guess the time
when the coin was to be raised in its value: but this was impossible;
for the rising was sudden and unexpected; whereas notice
was constantly given of the fall, at some distance of time.</p>

<p class='c001'>For example, the money was suddenly raised the 5th of March
1720, from 60 livres to 80 livres the marc; and the 11th of the same
month, notice was given, that on the 1st of April following, it
was to be brought down again to 70 livres <cite>per</cite> marc; and on the
first of May following, to 65 livres. The consequence of this was,
that from the 11th of March, people were glad to carry money to
the bank for notes, which were to stand at the same denomination,
whereas the silver was to diminish on the 1st of April.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly a great sum, above 44 millions, was brought in
during this interval.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the 1st of April came, and that the silver was brought to
70 livres the marc, those who were in possession of the paper, were
still prevented from realizing; because of the future diminution
which was to take place. When this term was come, people had
reason to imagine that the silver would for some time stand at 65
livres the marc; consequently, there was more to be gained in
stock-jobbing with the notes, than in realizing them in specie,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>which, in order to make profit of it, must have lain dead until a new
augmentation; which was a very uncertain event. In short, there
was no run upon the bank from the 1st to the 21st of the month
of May, when the famous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arret</i></span> in question was given. Then indeed
the run came on with violence, and payment was stopt.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The second reason why the effects were different when the
state changed the denomination of the coin, from what they proved
to be when the denomination of the paper was changed, I take to
be this,</p>

<p class='c001'>That in France the operations upon the coin had been familiar;
and were expected by every body: and, perhaps, the very making
the paper a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>monnoie fixe</i></span>, had for this reason added to the credit of it.
A most surprizing thing! The state took care always to gain, whether
they raised, or whether they diminished the value of the coin.
The stock-jobbers, therefore, never minded the coin at all. If they
could profit by an augmentation by foreseeing it, they realized; if
they could see a diminution before notice was given of it, then they
bought paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>The operations on the coin principally affected such as were
either respectively debtors or creditors, to people who were obliged
to pay, or to receive their debts in specie; or who had a fixed revenue
specified in a number of livres. There the disorder was great,
as has been frequently observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The operations upon the specie never could destroy the intrinsic
value of it, however they might prevent the circulation of
it for a fixed legal denomination; therefore it remained under all
combinations of circumstances, a thing valuable to be acquired;
and it still remained a commodity, desireable by all, and was therefore
constantly demanded.</p>

<p class='c001'>But a discredit cast upon the paper had a different effect. The
value <em>there</em> depended entirely upon the will of the state, and every
body saw that it was as easy to annihilate it, as to reduce it to one
half. The discredit, therefore, had the effect of stopping <em>the demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>for it</em>, that is, the currency; consequently, a run upon the bank
immediately took place.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, The rendring the value of the paper precarious, made every
possessor of it seek to realize it without delay. The proprietors of
the bank notes ran to the bank; and a run upon the bank, at a
time when it could offer payment for the notes in no other value
than actions, was a declaration of bankruptcy. Now it was the
run upon the bank; it was this claim which the subjects had a
right to make upon the bank, for which the King was guarantee,
which destroyed the credit of France; and it is very evident that no
operation upon the specie could possibly produce any such effect<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. It was a capital mistake in this diminution upon the paper to make it gradual.
Was it not evident that every mortal would seek to realize a note which was to diminish
in its value progressively every month? A note worth 10,000 livres, for example,
the 22d of May, was immediately reduced to 8000 livres, and the 1st of July, was to
be worth only 7500. This was plainly solliciting a run upon the bank. The stroke
should have been struck at once.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In short, had this operation upon the paper been suspended for a
few months; had the people of France been indulged in a little more
time, their infatuation in favour of the actions would have carried
them to employ all their bank notes in the purchase of those which
remained in the hands of the state. By this operation the far greater
part of the notes might have been withdrawn and destroyed, and
when the bank found themselves in a situation to answer the call of
all those which afterwards remained in circulation, then the state
might have boldly ventured to diminish the price of actions: because
if that stop had occasioned a run upon the bank for the outstanding
notes, there would have been coin enough to answer them
at their full value; and this would have confirmed the credit of the
bank more than any thing.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.2.35' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXV. <br /> <i>How a Bank may be safely established in France, as Matters stand at present.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The prerogative of the Kings of France is limited by no written
law, because he is acknowledged to be the legislature of his
kingdom; and the exercise of his power is only limited by maxims
of state. The first of which is, that he is to govern according to his
laws, and not according to his ambulatory will.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, in making of laws, the parliament have a sort of negative,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de facto</i></span>; because the whole regular and legal execution of every law
is committed to them: and if they refuse to register it, they refuse
to execute it; and a law without <em>execution</em> is, in fact, no law at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the King’s will can be carried into execution by a single
act of power, the authority of parliament is of no effect in preventing
it. When this requires a train of systematical administrations,
the concurrence of parliament, who hold the whole regular execution
of the laws, is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Banks of deposit and of circulation, stand, it must be confessed,
upon a very precarious footing, under such a government.</p>

<p class='c001'>An order from the King is at any time sufficient to command any
deposit of specie which can be made within the kingdom. While
this is the case, no paper can have any solidity, which draws its
security from such deposit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coin, therefore, must be banished from all banks in France: and
the use of them should be entirely limited to that of an office, for
the keeping of reckonings between people who have solid property,
and who may want, on a thousand occasions, to melt it
down in favour of consumption, trade, industry, agriculture, or
the like.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>In this light, a general bank may be established at Paris; and
branched out over the whole kingdom. The stock of it should consist
in land property, engaged unalienably, to make good the engagements
of the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>Notes should be issued upon solid security, bearing no interest
while they circulate as money; and when they return upon the
bank, either the original securities may be withdrawn, or payments
might be made by the transfer of a corresponding perpetual interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every province, every considerable city in the kingdom, should
be allowed to be interested in such a bank: and in every considerable
city, there should be an office for transacting such credits, and
for regularly receiving all payments of interest. If the King should
think fit to allow his mint to supply coin, or bullion, for bank
notes presented, at a determinate premium, he might by this operation
advance the commercial interests of his kingdom, in facilitating
the payments of a wrong balance of foreign commerce: but
without that regulation, the bank will be perfectly sufficient for
promoting and supporting domestic circulation. Every one who is
able to give security for a certain interest, will be sure to find money:
and as the expence of conducting such a bank will be very
small, the interest for money will be very low.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I said before, a bank of this kind would be no more than an
office, appointed for keeping accounts between people who are possessed
of any paper secured upon real and solid property: and farther,
in the beginning, at least, I would not advise to carry it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The general accompt of the bank would appear in a few articles,
viz. Credits given, so much; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>inde</i></span> of interest to be received, so
much.</p>

<p class='c001'>Notes returned, so much; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>inde</i></span> of interest to be paid, so much;
balance in favour of the bank, so much.</p>

<p class='c001'>A bank of this nature would answer every purpose for promoting
industry and domestic circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such a bank must neither issue, or ever receive coin in payment.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.2.36' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXVI. <br /> <i>Of Banks of deposit and transfer.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I now dismiss the subject of banks of circulation. The unspeakable
advantages drawn from this institution, when properly
regulated, in supplying money at all times to those who have property,
for the encouragement of industry, and for improvements
of all sorts, and the bad consequences which result to society, from
the abuse they are exposed to, has engaged me, perhaps, in too
long a discussion of particular combinations of circumstances relating
to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>I now come to treat of banks of deposit or of transfer of credit:
an institution of the greatest utility for commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>These two species of banks differ essentially in two particulars.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, That those of circulation serve the purpose of melting down
unwieldy property into money; and of preserving the quantity of
it at the proportion of the uses found for it. Those of deposit, are
calculated to preserve a sum of coin, or a quantity of precious
moveables, as a fund for carrying on the circulation of payments,
with a proportional value of credit or paper money secured upon
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, In the banks of circulation, the fund upon which the credit
is built, is not <em>corporeally</em> in the custody of the bank; in the other it is.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fundamental principle, then, of banks of deposit, is the faithful
preservation of the fund delivered to the bank, upon which
credit, in money, is taken for the value.</p>

<p class='c001'>If at any time a bank of deposit should lend, or should, in any
wise, dispose of any part of this fund, which may consist of coin,
bullion, or any other precious moveable, once delivered to them,
to the end that a credit in money may be writ down for it in their
books of transfer, in favour of the depositor, and his assigns; by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>that act, the bank departs from the principles upon which it is established.
And if any bank is established which, by their regulations,
may so dispose of the fund of their credit, then such a bank becomes
of a mixed nature, and participates of that of a bank of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>These things will be better understood by reasoning from an
example of a true bank of deposit.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.37' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXVII. <br /> <i>Of the Bank of Amsterdam.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Many authors have written concerning this great bank of deposit:
particularly, Davenant, Sir William Temple, Ricard,
in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Traité de Commerce revu par Struyk</cite></span>, the author of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Essay sur
le Commerce</cite></span>, and Mr. Megens, in his book, which has been translated
into English, under the title of <cite>The Universal Merchant</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these authors we find a number of facts, which I shall combine
with my own informations, and here apply principles to them; in
order to communicate a distinct idea of this establishment. A detail
of its particular operations regards practice, and falls not
within my subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>The original intention of the States of Holland, in establishing
the bank of Amsterdam, was to collect a large capital in coin within
that city, which might there perpetually remain, buried in a safe
repository for the purposes which we are now to explain.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to accomplish this plan, they established the bank upon
the 31st day of January 1609.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method they fell upon to collect the coin, was to order, that
all bills of exchange, for any sum exceeding 300 florins, should be
paid in specie to the bank; and that the holder of such bills should,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>instead of receiving the coin, have the value of it writ down in the
books of the bank to his credit, at his command, to be transferred
to any person he should appoint; but never more to be demandable
from the bank in specie.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this operation, the mass of coin circulating constantly from
hand to hand, between the merchants of Amsterdam, began, by
degrees, to be heaped up in the bank; and as the heap augmented,
so did the sum of credit augment upon the books of the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is evident, from this change in the mode of circulation, that no
loss could be incurred from the locking up of the coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>As long as coin is in a state of constant circulation, it can produce
no interest to any person. Interest commences from the moment
the coin begins to stagnate; that is to say, so soon as it comes into
the hands of one who has no ready money demand upon him.
When this happens the proprietor lends it at interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the credit in the books of the bank, which is every day
transferable at the bank, answers every purpose of coin, either for
<em>payment</em> or <em>loan</em>: and the proprietor has neither the trouble of receiving
the species, nor any risk from robbery, or false coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first advantage the city reaped from this institution, was, to
secure the residence of trade in that place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Capitals transferable only at the bank, laid the proprietors under
a necessity of fixing their dwelling where their funds were, and
where only they could be turned to accompt.</p>

<p class='c001'>It had another excellent effect in commerce: it pointed out the
men of substance. A credit in bank is no wise equivocal: it is a
fund of undoubted security.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the constitution of this bank we may form an estimate of
the extent of the deposit.</p>

<p class='c001'>It can only swallow up a sum equal to what is necessary for circulating
the payments of the city of Amsterdam. Were a sum exceeding
that to be shut up in the bank, and were the credits written
in the books of the bank to exceed that proportion, it is plain, that
the value of the bank money would sink immediately. The reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>is obvious: the credits transferable are of no use to those who have
no occasion to transfer; that is, to pay, lend, or exchange at Amsterdam.
So soon, then, as all the demand of Amsterdam is satisfied,
the proprietors of the overplus will seek to realize their superfluous
credit, in order to invest the value arising from it, in some
other place where a demand may arise.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to realize, they must sell their bank credit for coin; because
the bank pays only in transfer. Coin then would be demanded
preferably to credit in bank; consequently, coin would
rise in its proportional value to bank money, or bank money would
lose, which is the same thing. This fluctuation between bank money
and coin, leads me to explain what is called the agio of the
bank.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.38' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXVIII. <br /> <i>Of the Agio of the Bank of Amsterdam.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We have pointed out one motive for establishing a bank of deposit
at Amsterdam, viz. that of fixing the residence of trading
men in that city.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another was, to prevent the inconveniencies to which a small
state was exposed, by the introduction of bad coin, from all the
neighbouring countries in Europe, with whom they traded.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the territory of Holland there are no mines of gold and silver;
consequently all they have comes from other countries, as the return
of a favourable balance upon their commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the time the bank was established, the republic was in a state
of infancy; and any coin they had, was that of their old masters
the Spaniards. This was unequally coined; many pieces were
light; many had been clipped and washed. As they extended their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>traffic, they were obliged to receive great quantities from Germany,
which was still worse.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order then to prevent the circulation of such coin, and the perplexities
occasioned by it in all accounts, they established a bank,
and fixed the standard upon a silver coin called the ducatoon, to
which they gave the denomination of 3 florins or guilders bank
money.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as this coin also was unequal, like all the rest of the specie
in Europe, before the introduction of milled coin, and the policy
of weighing piece by piece at the mint, the bank appointed the
ducatoons to be received in bags of 200 pieces, weighing together
26 marcs 5 ounces 10 engles of Amsterdam troes, or gold weight;
which being reduced to aces, (the lowest denomination in this
weight) make 136,640 aces. This divided by 200, gives, for the
weight of 1 ducatoon, 683.2 aces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now convert these aces into troy grains, according to the
proportion established between Dutch aces and troy grains, in the
last chapter of the third book.</p>

<p class='c001'>The equation will stand thus,</p>

<p class='c001'>5192.8 aces, being equal to 3840 troy-grains, 683.2 aces, therefore,
will equal 505.21 troy-grains; which, consequently, is the
weight of a ducatoon, or of 3 florins bank money of Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next as to the fineness of this coin:</p>

<p class='c001'>The ducatoon was coined, according to the imperial standard, of
14 loots 16 grains fine: that is to say, it is <sup>268</sup>⁄<sub>288</sub> parts fine, and <sup>20</sup>⁄<sub>288</sub>
parts alloy.</p>

<p class='c001'>To find, therefore, the number of Hollands aces, and of troy
grains of fine silver in the ducatoon, state the two following proportions:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c028'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>288 : 268 :: 683.25 : 635.75 aces fine.</div>
      <div class='line'>288 : 268 :: 505.21 : 470.13 troy-grains fine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In the last place, if we divide the number of aces, and troy grains
fine in the ducatoon, by 3, we shall see the exact weight of fine
silver in 1 florin of Amsterdam bank money.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><sup>635.75</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> = 211.91 aces, and <sup>470.13</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> = 156.71 troy-grains fine.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>These calculations premised, it would be an easy thing to fix the
exact par of the metals, between sterling and bank money of Amsterdam,
were the British coin of legal weight, and were the metals
there rightly proportioned. But is it to be supposed, that any person
who has bank money of Amsterdam, would exchange, at the
par of the metals, with sterling silver, which is many <i>per cent.</i> too
light, or against English bank notes paid in gold, always overrated
with regard to the silver, and often too light also?</p>

<p class='c001'>While, therefore, the coin of Great Britain stands upon the present
footing, all calculations of the par of exchange, as it is commonly
computed, upon the intrinsic value of the coins of other
nations, must be delusive and of no utility whatever.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the sake of giving an example, however, here is the real par
of the two currencies, upon silver sterling coin of full weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>One pound sterling should contain, as has been said, of fine silver
1718.7 troy grains, and contains 240 pence sterling: state, therefore,
the following proportion, and you will find how many pence sterling
one florin of Amsterdam banco should be worth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>1718.7 : 240 :: 156.71 : 21.883.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Thus 21.883 pence sterling is exactly the real par of an Amsterdam
florin banco, supposing sterling money to be silver, at the full
weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>The florin bank money being regulated upon the ducatoon, an
old species not now coined, the fineness of the silver was determined;
and the weight of the 200 ducatoons being determined also,
this regulation determined the weight of single pieces, and fixed
the standard of the florin banco, in weight and fineness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The current money in Holland, coined by the state, is the florin
of 200.21 aces fine, as we have seen in the last chapter of the preceding
book.</p>

<p class='c001'>So soon as the state coined their current florins at 200.21 aces, it
is evident, that the ducatoon, which contains three times 211.91
aces, must rise in its value. Accordingly, the piece which was in
bank money, 3 florins, became 3 florins 3 stivers current money.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>This difference is what is called the agio of the bank of Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this it appears, that the advanced value of the bank money
above the current money of Holland, is not owing to the great credit
of the bank, as some imagine, but to the superior intrinsic value
of the coin upon which the standard of the bank money is fixed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next determine the exact difference between the bank and
the current money, which difference I shall call the <em>intrinsic agio</em>:
for this purpose state this proportion;</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>200.21 : 211.91 :: 100 : 105.84</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>From which it appears, that the bank money is 5.84 <i>per cent.</i> intrinsically
better than the current money of Holland.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen in the chapter referred to, in what a confused state
the Dutch coin is at present, and how it becomes a science to comprehend
any thing concerning it. For this reason it is, that the regular
agio of the bank money of Amsterdam is always supposed
to be 5 <i>per cent.</i> Farther,</p>

<p class='c001'>The ducatoon, upon which it is regulated, passes for 3 florins
3 stivers, which is just 5 <i>per cent.</i> better than 3 florins, at which it
was rated when the bank was established; but most of the coins
which circulate are light.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who conduct the affairs of the bank, have now lost sight
of this original coin, which is rarely found circulating, in considerable
sums; and they consider the florin according to its intrinsic
worth of 211.91 aces of fine silver; and as the value of silver varies,
they publish regulations for receiving coin, such as Spanish dollars,
French crowns, &amp;c. according as they find the proportion of their
worth in bank money: and compounding the value of gold with
the value of silver, they make the same regulations as to gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have insisted too long already upon the subtilties of the variations
in the proportion between gold and silver, to take it up again
in this place. My intention is to explain the principles upon which
this great bank of deposit is established, and not to descend into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>detail of the mechanism of their adapting the variable coins of
Europe to their own standard.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said, that the sum of credit, written in the books of the
bank, is in proportion to the quantity of bank money necessary for
circulating the trade of Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consequently, as this circulation increases, the demand for bank
money increases also.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again; in proportion as the demand for bank money increases,
the agio rises; and on the other hand, as the demand for current
money increases, the agio falls.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we saw in the last war, <i>ann.</i> 1760, 1761, 1762, that agio was
below 5 <i>per cent.</i> The reason was plain. The great circulation
carried on in Amsterdam was considerably directed towards the
uses of the war. <em>There</em> bank money was of no use; coin only
could serve the purpose. Accordingly agio fell to —— <i>per cent.</i>
and as gold was much more easily transported than silver, that
metal rose ¼ <i>per cent.</i> above the ordinary proportion of 1 to 14½.</p>

<p class='c001'>Demand regulates every thing; and this demand makes the
agio fluctuate; sometimes rising above, and sometimes falling bellow
5 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.2.39' class='c015'>CHAP. XXXIX. <br /> <i>Continuation of the same Subject; and concerning the Circulation of Coin through the Bank of Amsterdam.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Hitherto we have represented this bank as a gulf, which
is calculated to swallow up the coin of Europe; without
having pointed out any faculty of throwing up a part of the treasure
so secured, in case of an overcharge.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>This has appeared a mystery to many, and a defect in the constitution
of the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>But when the principles upon which it is established come to be
compared with some branches of their administration, which are
publicly known, perhaps the mysterious part may be unravelled.
And although I do not pretend to give an entire satisfaction as to
every minute particular, I think I can shew how, and to what extent,
the treasure may circulate, so as to occasion no abuse, either
from the hoarding it on one hand, or from the dissipation of it,
for the service of the state, on the other: and if all these conjectures
shall be found to hang together, and appear consistent with
principles, without being contradicted by any known fact, then I
may conclude, that such a system of banking as I describe, is at
least a possible supposition, whether it exactly coincides with that
of Amsterdam, or not. And who knows but my speculations may
enable some person of more knowlege and more sagacity than I
am possessed of, to render this curious operation of credit still more
generally understood than hitherto it has been.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have shewn how the agio rises and falls, according to the demand
for bank money.</p>

<p class='c001'>So long, therefore, as the agio does not fall below the difference
between the value of the two currencies, it is a proof that all the
credit writ in the books of the bank does not exceed the uses for
it: consequently, the coin locked up, which never can exceed the
credit on the transfer books, and which, were it not locked up,
could be of no more service than the credit itself, in circulating
the trade of Amsterdam, does not exceed its due proportion: consequently,
it is not hurtfully withdrawn from commerce; consequently,
no abuse is implied from the hoarding of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But let me suppose a case, which may happen; to wit, that for
a certain time, the trade of Amsterdam may demand a larger supply
of credit in bank, than is necessary upon an average. Will not
this raise the agio? No doubt. If the agio rises so high as to
afford a premium upon carrying coin to the bank, upon the footing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>of their own regulations, this will augment the sum of bank
credit; because the money so carried to the bank, becomes incorporated
with the bank stock; the value is writ in the books of the
bank; and when this is done, the coin is locked up for ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>If then it should happen, that the trade of Amsterdam should
afterwards diminish, so as to return to the ordinary standard, will
not this overcharge of credit depress the rate of bank money,
and sink the agio too much below the par of the intrinsic value of
the two currencies?</p>

<p class='c001'>To these difficulties I answer, like one who, being ignorant of
facts, which I never could get ascertained by any person in Holland
to whom I had access for information, and which remained
hid from most people in the deep arcana of Amsterdam politics,
must have recourse to conjectures, founded upon natural sagacity.</p>

<p class='c001'>First then, The city of Amsterdam knows, from long experience,
the rate of demand for bank money; and it is not to be supposed,
that upon any sudden emergency, which may <em>heighten</em> that
demand for a time, they should be such novices as to increase
the credit upon their books so far, as to run any risk of overstocking
the market with it; especially as, on such occasions, the deficiency
of bank credit might be supplied with coin, constantly to
be found in the city of Amsterdam, as we shall explain presently.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther, Who will say, that there does not reside a power in the
managers of this bank, to issue coin for the superfluous credit, in
case that, in spite of all precautions to prevent it, a redundancy of
bank credit should at any time be found upon their books?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is very true, that no person, having credit in bank, can demand
coin for such credit; and as no demand of that sort can
ever be made, it is very natural to suppose, that a redundancy of
coin and credit can never be purged off.</p>

<p class='c001'>During my stay in Holland, I was at great pains, to no purpose,
to discover whether ever the bank issued any part of their credit
cash upon any such occasions. Every one I conversed with was of
opinion, that if ever any coin had been taken from the treasure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>the bank, it must have been by authority of the states, for national
purposes: a step conducted with the greatest secrecy; and the
matter of fact, I found, was extremely doubtful. But this is nothing
to the present purpose. That the coin may be disposed of,
I allow, though I do not believe it; but how is the superfluous
credit, writ in the books, to be disposed of? There lies the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The popular opinion is, that coin has been taken out for the
service of the state: the opinion of many intelligent men is quite
contrary.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am now to give my opinion, not only as to this point, but
upon the main question; and this not from information, but from
conjecture; which I shall humbly submit to the better judgment
of my reader.</p>

<p class='c001'>My opinion then is, 1<i>mo</i>, That every shilling written in the
books of the bank, is actually locked up, in coin, in the bank repositories.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, That although, by the regulations of the bank, no coin
can be issued to any person who demands it in consequence of his
credit in bank; yet I have not the least doubt, but <em>that both the
credit written in the books of the bank, and the cash in their repositories
which balances it, may suffer alternate augmentations and diminutions, according
to the greater or less demand for bank money</em>. If I can prove this,
all difficulties will be removed.</p>

<p class='c001'>My reasons for being of this opinion are,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, From principles, I must conclude, that if, upon any occasion
whatever, even when the smallest demand for bank money,
and the greatest demand for coin takes place, there was an impossibility
of producing the least diminution of bank credit, or of
procuring any supply of the metals from the bank, the consequence
certainly would be felt, by an extraordinary fall in the value
of bank money; or which is the same thing, in other words,
by an extraordinary rise in the value of the metals, when compared
with bank money.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Now, this is a case which never happens. Variations upon the
rate of agio, of 2 or 3 <i>per cent.</i> perhaps more, are frequent and
familiar. The demands of trade, for coin or credit, are so fluctuating,
that such variations are unavoidable; but were there an
overcharge of bank credit, which no power could diminish, that
overcharge would quickly be perceived; because the fluctuations
of the agio would entirely cease; as the balance of a scale, nearly
in equilibrio, ceases from a total overcharge on one side.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, My second reason is founded upon a matter of fact, which
I must now apply.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are upon the square before the town-house of Amsterdam,
(the place de Dam) between 10 and 11 in the morning, a number
of cashiers, whose business it is to buy and sell bank credit, for
current coin. They bargain with all those who have occasion
either to buy or sell; and according to the demand for specie, or
bank credit, the agio rises or sinks: and as these cashiers must
constantly gain, whether they furnish bank credit or current coin,
since they are never the demanders in either operation, it is commonly
found, that there is in their favour about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub> <i>per cent.</i> or perhaps
⅛ <i>per cent.</i> according to the revolutions in the demand: that
is to say, one who would first buy specie, and then sell it, would
lose ⅛, or perhaps but <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub> upon his operation.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this circumstance of buying and selling of bank credit
with coin, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>, I think I can resolve the mystery mentioned
above, viz. how the constant accumulation of coin in the
bank of Amsterdam, should never have the effect of depreciating
their bank money, by augmenting, beyond the demand for it,
the quantity of their deposit, and of the credit written in their
books.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a matter of fact, that the bank lends both coin and credit to
the brokers, cashiers, or lombards, who are constantly found on
the place de Dam.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whenever, therefore, the bank finds that agio falls too low,
with respect to the coin; and when, in consequence of that, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>demand for coin <em>increases</em>; then they lend <em>coin</em> out of their repositories
to the brokers; and when it <em>rises</em>, they lend <em>credit</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This coin the brokers dispose of to those who have bank money,
and who want to convert it into coin. They sell the coin for bank
credit: the purchaser writes off the transfer in favour of the
broker, and he again repays the value of the coin to the bank,
by transferring the credit he obtained for the coin, in favour of
the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>This done, the bank may expunge this credit from their books;
by which means their deposit of coin is diminished, and also the
sum of credit which was found superfluous.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, on the other hand, the circulation of the trade of the city
should, in a short time afterwards, begin to increase, those who
have coin, which in that case would not so well serve the uses of
circulation as the bank credit, come with it to the brokers, who
sell them bank credit for it; this coin the brokers deliver to the
bank, which writes off the credit lent to the broker, in favour of
him who has paid his coin for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is, as far as I can guess, the nature of the circulation of
the coin in the bank of Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a curious method of preserving an exact proportion between
the coin in deposit, the credit written in their books of transfer,
and the demand for bank money.</p>

<p class='c001'>The plan is quite consistent with principles, and checks exactly
with those matters of fact which are known to all the world.
Whether the operation be conducted exactly in the way I have represented
it, or not, is a matter of small consequence to us, who
aim at nothing more than the investigation <em>of the principles</em>
upon which such operations <em>may</em> be conducted.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we compare this operation with those of the bank of circulation,
which we have already explained, we find a great analogy
between them.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how the notes issued by banks of circulation increase
and diminish according to demand: and now we see how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the same principle operates in banks of deposit, which issue no
coin on demand. In the first case, the mass of securities, or coin
of the bank, is diminished, without the consent of the bank, by
the act of their creditors; that is, the holders of the notes. In
the last case, the creditors, or persons who have credit in bank,
cannot, by their own act, diminish the quantity of the coin deposited,
nor of the credit written; but the bank itself, by the help of
those interposed persons, the brokers on the place de Dam, is enabled
to preserve an exact balance between bank money and the
demand for it; augmenting it as it is demanded, and diminishing
it when it is found to regorge.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this I conclude, that the treasure of the bank of Amsterdam
is not near so great as some authors, from mere conjecture,
have asserted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The author of the Essay on commerce, reckons it at four hundred
millions of guilders; and the Amsterdam edition carries in
the margin a correction, which gives us to understand, that it
amounts to between eight and nine hundred millions. Davenant
esteems it at 36 millions sterling. Mr. Megens, an author of great
judgment and sagacity, esteems this treasure at no more than about
60 millions of guilders, or about 5,500,000<i>l.</i> sterling; a sum (says
he) wherewith great things may be done. Univers. Merchant,
sect. 61. I agree entirely with him, that for the ready-money demands
of the trade of Amsterdam, that sum, constantly in circulation,
may go a great length.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has misled most people in their estimation of this treasure, is
the appearance of a constant accumulation, without any restitution:
but that there is a constant egress, as well as ingress of coin
to this bank, I think I have rendred pretty evident.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the permanent credit written in the books of transfer,
concerning which we have been speaking, the bank of Amsterdam
receives, in deposit, vast sums of coin every year, which are not
incorporated with the bank treasure, but remain in the bags in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>which they are delivered, under the joint seals of the bank and
of the person who delivers them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This operation comes next to be explained.</p>

<p class='c001'>The trade of Holland draws a constant flux of coin and bullion
into the country; and that trade sends a constant flux out of it.
The establishment of the bank of Amsterdam renders the use of
this coin and bullion, upon many occasions, superfluous, as money.</p>

<p class='c001'>It therefore remains as a commodity, the value of which rises
according to exigencies, or the demand for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the precious metals come from Spain, Portugal, and other
nations, who owe a balance to the Dutch, they are lodged in the
bank of Amsterdam in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proprietors carry them to the bank in sacs composed of a determinate
number of pieces, and the sac must be of a determinate
weight, according to the regulations of the bank, from time to
time; for which the bank writes off credit in bank, at certain rates,
according to the coin lodged, to the account of the proprietor.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as this coin is received, upon condition that it may be drawn
out again, so soon as the depositor shall demand it; instead of
writing off the <em>whole value</em> upon the books of the bank, they only
write off a <em>certain part</em>, (suppose 90 <i>per cent.</i>) and for the remaining
10 <i>per cent.</i> they deliver what they call a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recipisse</i></span>, which is an obligation
by the bank to re-deliver, upon demand, the individual
sacs, sealed with the seals of the bank and of the depositor. This
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recipisse</i></span> is transferable at the will of the person to whom it is delivered.
Farther,</p>

<p class='c001'>He who has put his coin so in deposit, becomes bound to pay to
the bank ½, ¼, or ⅛<i>per cent.</i> every six months, according to the
coin: that is, upon gold ½ <i>per cent.</i> on pieces of eight and rix-dollars
¼; on ducatoons ⅛ <i>per cent.</i> and in case he neglects so to do,
then the coin becomes consolidated with the treasure of the bank,
and can no more be drawn out, in virtue of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recipisse</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being performed, the depositor may transfer, at will, all
the 90 <i>per cent.</i> of his credit, in the course of his business; and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>soon as the <em>value of coin</em> rises in the market, he must fill up his
credit in bank to the full value of the 90 <i>per cent.</i> and then presenting
his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recipisse</i></span>, he receives back his own individual coin, sealed
with his own seal, as when at first delivered.</p>

<p class='c001'>If he finds that it is either inconvenient for him to fill up his
credit, or that he has no occasion for his coin, upon the rise in its
value, he may then sell his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recipisse</i></span> to another, who has credit in
bank equal to the value of the deposit; and he, in virtue of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recipisse</i></span> transferred to him, withdraws the coin, as the person might
have done who put it in deposit.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recipisse</i></span> itself, which is what gives a right to the coin to any
one who is the proprietor of that paper, and who has credit in
bank for the sum contained in it, rises and sinks in its value, according
to the price of the coin to which it carries a right.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this manner coin, which otherwise would be dead in a warehouse,
is made to circulate, in favour of the owner, during the
deposit, remaining at the same time always at his command; and
the keeping of the coin brings into the bank a small profit, but
which, by constant accumulation, becomes considerable.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said above, that the bank of Amsterdam puts forth,
from time to time, what regulations they think fit, as to the rate
at which they receive the different species of coin. These regulations
are formed according to the fluctuation of the value of the
metals. When silver rises above the proportion it had before, with
respect to gold, then the silver species is received at a higher rate
than formerly. When gold rises in proportion to silver, then the
gold coins are received at a higher rate than formerly.</p>

<p class='c001'>This regulation produces the same effect as that, which I formerly
recommended in the third book, would do, in fixing a
standard for the unit of the money of Great Britain, according to
the mean proportion of the metals: and it was for this reason, that
[Book III. part I. chap. 1.] I asserted the bank money of Amsterdam
to be an invariable unit, which the art of man had invented;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>that it stood like a rock in the sea, immoveable by the fluctuating
proportion between the metals.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is no objection against this, to allege the variation of the agio,
and the fluctuation of the value of bank money according to
demand. These variations ought to be referred to the coin, not
to the bank money: the bank money is to be considered as fixed,
because it has all the characters of invariability.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, indeed, the affairs of the bank came to be ill administred,
and that the credit written in the bank were allowed to swell so
far beyond the demand for it, as to sink the value of bank money
so far below the rate of coin as to make it impossible to recover
itself; then I should allow that the bank money was no longer an
invariable standard: but in this case, I should consider the bank as
in a kind of political disease, because it would then be withdrawn
from under the influence of its own principles, which hitherto
has never been the case.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been imagined by many, that the treasure of the bank of
Amsterdam has been, upon certain occasions, made use of for the
public service. This is a conjecture merely; and perhaps it has
been owing to the opinion which commonly prevails, that the treasure
far exceeds all the uses which it can serve for. But as I am
persuaded, 1<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>mo</cite></span>, That this opinion is void of all foundation; 2<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>do</cite></span>,
That the treasure never can exceed the credits written; and,
3<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>tio</cite></span>, That the credits never can exceed the uses those merchants
have for them: so I am of opinion, that a value, in coin, to the
full extent of those credits, actually exists in the repositories of
the bank; because if I should suppose the contrary, it would
imply a notorious infidelity in the bank administration: an infidelity,
which, if ever it should be discovered, would overturn the
whole credit of the bank, and, at one stroke, destroy the whole
trade of that city. Now the use of three or four millions sterling,
to the states of Holland, which they can procure when they will,
at a very moderate interest, is not an object in the eyes of that sagacious
government, sufficient to engage them to tamper with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>bank treasure: and the rather, that were they driven to the necessity
of having recourse to the bank, I make not the least doubt
but that so great a company would be of more service to the state
in writing off upon an occasion a <em>temporary, untransferable credit at
interest</em>, which might afterwards be expunged, in order to procure
coin within the country, than by delivering the coin corresponding
to the credit of private merchants, which they must look upon as
a most sacred deposit.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we compare the credit of the bank of Amsterdam, with the
credit of the bank of England, we shall find the first infinitely
inferior to the latter as to extent, though not one bit inferior with
respect to the solidity of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The extent of the credit of the bank of Amsterdam is limited to
the sum of the credits written in their books, either in permanent
transfer, as I shall call it, or in credit on cash deposited upon <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recipisse</i></span>.
All this credit put together, cannot extend beyond the limits
of the circulation of the city of Amsterdam, in their domestic
dealings, and in their exchange business; which last is indeed
very great.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the credit of the bank of England is equal (in a manner) to
all the circulation and exchange business of London, and all the
taxes paid in Great Britain. This bank, in circulating its paper, is
not limited to the weight of coin in England. The whole interest
of the national debt, and expence of the state, may be paid in the
paper of the bank, and be perfectly well secured, although their
treasure in coin may seldom amount to above four millions sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must however allow, that banks of circulation, when ill
conducted, are liable to great abuse; as has been abundantly explained
in treating of the Missisippi. But how is abuse to be prevented,
while men conduct? And disasters may happen to a bank
of deposit, to which the other is not so much exposed. May not
the treasure of the bank of Amsterdam be lent out on bad security?
May not the state lay hold of it? May not an earthquake swallow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>up the stadthouse? May not the sea break in, and demolish it?
May not another invader, like the late King of France, in 1672, be
more successful, and carry off the bank?</p>

<p class='c001'>These are abuses and calamities to which the bank of Amsterdam
is exposed; and from many of which the bank of England
is in a great measure protected.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the banks I have mentioned, not so much with a view
to give an historical account of their operations, as to illustrate
the principles on which they are established, there are many
others in Europe of great and extensive credit; such as that of
Hamburg, Venice, Genoa (until the state spent the treasure deposited)
Nuremberg, &amp;c. Every one of these participate more of the
nature of that of Amsterdam, than of those in Great Britain. They
are more calculated for preserving the standard of their bank money,
against the adulterations of coin, and for providing a fund
of cash, transferable in bank credit, than for the assistance of government,
or the melting down of solid property, which are the
great advantages peculiar to <em>banks of circulation</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>These last are also infinitely more lucrative to the bankers than
those of deposit, from the interest they draw from credits given,
discount of bills, and loans to government.</p>

<p class='c001'>The profits on the bank of Amsterdam are very trifling. They
are confined to the small emoluments of 2 stivers for every transfer;
besides the interest they draw from the brokers on the place <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>de Dam</i></span>,
for the coin and credit they furnish them with; and, in the last
place, the ½, ¼, or ⅛ <i>per cent.</i> every six months, for the coin deposited,
in order to be afterwards drawn out. But on the other hand, they
are freed from the enormous expence of providing coin for the
payment of foreign balances, and from the great detail of business
which the circulation of paper implies.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='large'>PART III.</span> <br /> OF EXCHANGE.</h3>
<hr class='c014' />

<h4 id='ch4.3.1' class='c020'>CHAP. I. <br /> <i>Of the first Principles of Exchange.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>Having ended what I had to say of banks, in which most of
the principles of private credit have been sufficiently deduced,
I now proceed to the doctrine of exchange, which is the principal
operation of mercantile credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>The security which merchants commonly take from one another
when they circulate their business, is a bill of exchange, or a note
of hand: these are looked upon as payment. When they give credit
to one another in account, or otherwise, the cause of confidence
is of a mixed nature; established partly upon the security of their
effects, partly on the capacity, integrity, and good fortune, of the
person to whom the credit is given.</p>

<p class='c001'>No man but a merchant has any idea of the extent and nature of
this kind of credit. It is a thing to be felt, but cannot be reduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>to principles; and merchants themselves can lay down no certain
rules concerning it. It is an operation which totally depends upon
their own sagacity.</p>

<p class='c001'>But when they deal by bills of exchange, the case is very different.
The punctuality of acquitting those obligations is essential to
commerce; and no sooner is a merchant’s accepted bill protested,
than he is considered as a bankrupt. For this reason, the laws of
most nations have given very extraordinary privileges to bills of
exchange. The security of trade is essential to every society; and
were the claims of merchants to linger under the formalities of
courts of law, when liquidated by bills of exchange, faith, confidence,
and punctuality, would quickly disappear; and the great
engine of commerce would be totally destroyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>A regular bill of exchange is a mercantile contract, in which four
persons are concerned, viz. 1. The drawer, who receives the value:
2. His debtor in a distant place, upon whom the bill is drawn, and
who must accept and pay it: 3. The person who gives value for
the bill, to whose order it is to be paid: and 4. The person to whom
it is ordered to be paid, creditor to the third.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this operation, reciprocal debts, due in two distant parts, are
paid by a sort of transfer, or permutation of debtors and creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'>(A) in London, is creditor to (B) in Paris, value 100<i>l.</i> (C) again
in London, is debtor to (D) in Paris for a like sum. By the operation
of the bill of exchange, the London creditor is paid by the London
debtor, and the Paris creditor is paid by the Paris debtor; consequently,
the two debts are paid, and no money is sent from London
to Paris, nor from Paris to London.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this example, (A) is the drawer, (B) is the accepter, (C) is the
purchaser of the bill, and (D) receives the money. Two persons
here receive the money, (A) and (D), and two pay the money, (B)
and (C); which is just what must be done when two debtors and
two creditors clear accounts.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the plain principle of a bill of exchange. From which it
appears, that reciprocal and equal debts only can be acquitted by
them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>When it therefore happens, that the reciprocal debts of London
and Paris (to use the same example) are not equal, there arises a
balance on one side. Suppose London to owe Paris a balance, value
100<i>l.</i> How can this be paid? I answer, that it may either be done
with or without the intervention of a bill.</p>

<p class='c001'>With a bill, if an exchanger, finding a demand for a bill upon
Paris, for the value of 100<i>l.</i> when Paris owes no more to London,
sends 100<i>l.</i> to his correspondent at Paris in coin, at the expence, I
suppose, of 1<i>l.</i> and then, having become creditor on Paris, he can
give a bill for the value of 100<i>l.</i> upon his being repaid his expence,
and paid for his risk and trouble.</p>

<p class='c001'>Or it may be paid without a bill, if the London debtor sends the
coin himself to his Paris creditor, without employing an exchanger.</p>

<p class='c001'>This last example shews of what little use bills are in the payment
of balances. As far as the debts are equal, nothing can be
more useful than bills of exchange; but the more they are useful
in this easy way of business, the less profit there is to any person to
make a trade of exchange, when he is not himself concerned, either
as debtor or creditor.</p>

<p class='c001'>When merchants have occasion to draw and remit bills for the
liquidation of their own debts, active and passive, in distant parts,
they meet upon change; where, to pursue the former example,
the creditors upon Paris, when they want money for bills, look out
for those who are debtors to it. The debtors to Paris again, when
they want bills for money, seek for those who are creditors upon
it. This is a representation of what we have frequently called the
money market, in which the <em>demand</em> is for <em>money</em>, or for <em>bills</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This market is constantly attended by brokers, who relieve the
merchant of the trouble of searching for those he wants. To the
broker every one communicates his wants, so far as he finds it prudent;
and by going about among all the merchants, the broker
discovers the side upon which the greater demand lies, for money,
or for bills.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>We have often observed, that he who is the demander in any bargain,
has constantly the disadvantage in dealing with him of whom
he demands. This is no where so much the case as in exchange,
and renders secrecy very essential to individuals among the merchants.
If the London merchants want to pay their debts to Paris,
when there is a balance against London, it is their interest to conceal
their debts, and especially the necessity they may be under to
pay them; from the fear that those who are creditors upon Paris
would demand too high a price for the exchange over and above par.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, those who are creditors upon Paris, when
Paris owes a balance to London, are as careful in concealing what
is owing to them by Paris, from the fear that those who are debtors
to Paris would avail themselves of the competition among the Paris
creditors, in order to obtain bills for their money, below the value
of them, when at par. A creditor upon Paris, who is greatly pressed
for money at London, will willingly abate something of his debt,
in order to get one who will give him money for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not my intention to dip into the intricacies of exchange: all
intricacies must here be banished; and instead of technical terms,
which are very well adapted for expressing them, recourse must be
had to plain language, for pointing out the simple operations of
this trade. It is by this method that principles must be deduced,
and from principles we shall draw the consequences which may be
derived from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the operation carried on among merchants upon Change,
which we have been describing, we may discover the consequence
of their separate and jarring interests. They are constantly interested
in the state of the balance. Those who are creditors on Paris, fear
a balance due to London; those who are debtors to Paris, dread a
balance due to Paris. The interest of the first is to dissemble what
they fear; that of the last, to exaggerate what they wish. The
brokers are those who determine the course of the day: and the
most intelligent merchants are those who dispatch their business
before the fact is known.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Now I ask, how trade, in general, is interested in the question,
who shall outwit, and who shall be outwitted, in this complicated
operation of exchange among merchants?</p>

<p class='c001'>The interest of trade and of the nation is principally concerned
in the proper method of paying and receiving the balances. It is
also concerned in preserving a just equality of profit and loss among
all the merchants, relative to the real state of the balance. Unequal
competition among men engaged in the same pursuit, constantly
draws along with it bad consequences to the general undertaking,
as has often been observed; and secrecy in trade will be
found, upon examination, to be much more useful to merchants
in their private capacity, than to the trade they are carrying on.</p>

<p class='c001'>Merchants, we have said, in speaking of the bank of England,
endeavour to simplify their business as much as possible; and commit
to brokers many operations which require no peculiar talents
to execute. This of exchange is of such a nature that it is hardly
possible for a merchant to carry on the business of his bills, without
their assistance, upon many occasions. When merchants come
upon Change, they are so full of fears and jealousies, that they will
not open themselves to one another, lest they should discover what
they want to conceal. The broker is a confidential man, in some
degree, between parties, and brings them together.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the merchants, who circulate among themselves their reciprocal
debts and credits, arising from their importation and exportation
of goods, there is another set of merchants who deal in
exchange; which is the importation and exportation of money and
bills.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were there never any balance on the trade of nations, exchangers
and brokers would find little employment: reciprocal and equal
debts would easily be transacted openly between the parties themselves.
No man feigns and dissembles, except when he thinks he
has an interest in so doing.</p>

<p class='c001'>But when balances come to be paid, exchange becomes intricate;
and merchants are so much employed in particular branches of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>business, that they are obliged to leave the liquidation of their debts
to a particular set of men, who make it turn out to the best advantage
to themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whenever a balance is to be paid, that payment costs, as we have
seen, an additional expence to those of the place who owe it, over
and above the value of the debt.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, this expence be a loss to the trading man, he must
either be repaid this loss by those whom he serves, that is, by the
nation; or the trade he carries on will become less profitable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every one will agree, I believe, that the expence of high exchange
upon paying a balance, is a loss to a people, no way to be compensated
by the advantages they reap from enriching the few individuals
among them, who gain by contriving methods to pay it
off: and if an argument is necessary to prove this proposition, it
may be drawn from this principle, to wit, whatever renders the
profit upon trade precarious or uncertain, is a loss to trade in general:
this loss is a consequence of high exchange; and although a
profit does result from it upon one branch of trade, the exchange
business, yet that cannot compensate the loss upon every other.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may, therefore, here repeat what we have said above, that
the more difficulty is found in paying a balance, the greater is the
loss to the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being admitted, I shall here enumerate all the difficulties
which occur in paying of balances. Most of them have been already
mentioned from their relation to subjects already discussed; and
could it be supposed, that every reader has retained the whole chain
of reasoning already gone through, a repetition in this place would
be superfluous: but as that cannot be expected, I shall, in as short
and distinct a manner as possible, recapitulate, under four articles,
what I hope will be sufficient to refresh the memory upon each of
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The first difficulty which occurs in paying a balance, is to
determine exactly the true and intrinsic value of the metals or coin
in which it is to be paid; that is to say, the real par.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>2<i>do</i>, How to remove the domestic inconveniences which occur in
paying with the metals or coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, How to prevent the price of exchange from operating upon
the whole mass of reciprocal payments, instead of affecting only
the balance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remedies and palliatives for these three inconveniencies once
discovered, comes the last question, viz. How, when other expedients
prove ineffectual for the payment of a balance, the same
may be paid by the means of credit, without the intervention of
coin; and who are those who should conduct that operation.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.3.2' class='c015'>CHAP. II. <br /> <i>How to determine exactly the true and intrinsic value of the Metals, Coin, or Money, in which a Balance to foreign Nations is to be paid.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>This first question regards the whole mass of reciprocal payments,
as well as that of the balance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every payment to be made of a determinate and fixed value;
that is to say, of a liquidated debt, must be paid in a value equally
determinate in its nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>This I suppose to be the case, whether payment be made in the
precious metals unmanufactured, bullion, or in a nation’s coin, or
in denominations of money of account. All payment in merchandize,
except bullion, must suffer conversions of value before the
debts can be liquidated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Money of accompt, which is what we understand by denominations,
we have defined to be a scale of equal parts, calculated to
determine the value of things, relatively to one another. It must,
therefore, be by the money of accompt of different nations, that
the value of bullion and of coin can be determined.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>When coin is introduced, the denominations of money are realized
in a determinate quantity of the precious metals, and the
fabrication of the bullion into coin, raises the value of that commodity,
bullion, like the manufacturing of every other natural
production.</p>

<p class='c001'>When coin, therefore, is employed in paying sums according to
the legal denomination which it carries, it is money, not merchandize;
but when it is given at any other rate than its denomination,
it is merchandize, not money.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the third book, we have shewn how utterly impossible it is to
realize with exactness, the denominations of money of accompt, in
the metals which are constantly varying in their value, and exposed
to waste in circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have shewn, by many examples, how, in fact, the value of
the pound sterling has been subject to great vicissitudes of late, from
the great disorder of the coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The coin of France is, indeed, upon a better footing in point of
uniformity of weight, than ours; and the proportion of the metals
in it comes nearer their present value in the market: but then as
oft as the balance turns against France, the high imposition upon
her coinage, exposes the coin to great fluctuations of value, when
compared with bullion in the Paris market. This is also to be
ascribed to the imperfection of the metals when used as money,
while they are merchandize at the same time.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being the case, the way to calculate the real par of exchange
between nations, who have in common no determinate and invariable
money, exclusive of coin, is to consider fine gold and silver
as the next best standard.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a merchandize which never varies in its quality. Fine
gold is always the same in every mass; and weight for weight,
there is no difference in its value or quality any where.</p>

<p class='c001'>This standard being once adopted, the calculation of the real par
becomes an easy operation to those who know the course of the
bullion market in the two places exchanging.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>If, by the exportation of all the heavy coin of London, bills must
be paid in a worn out currency, the rise in the price of gold in their
market, above mint price, will mark pretty nearly how far it is
light.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, on the other hand, the wars of France, or an unfavourable
balance upon her trade, shall oblige her to export her coin, that
operation will <em>sink</em> the value of it, or <em>raise</em> the price of bullion,
which ever way you choose to express it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not here a proper place to resume the question, which of the
two expressions is the most proper: we are here considering the
value of the bullion as what is fixed, because it answers the purpose.
But whether we say that bullion <em>rises</em> in the markets of Paris and
London; or that the value of their currencies <em>sink</em>, though from very
different causes, the calculation of the real par will proceed with
equal accuracy. An example will illustrate this.</p>

<p class='c001'>When <em>fine</em> gold is at the lowest price to which it can ever fall at
Paris, that is to say, at the mint price, it is worth 740 livres 9 sols,
or 740.45 livres <i>per</i> mark, in decimals, for the ease of calculation.
The mark contains eight ounces Paris weight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were the ounces of Paris equal to those of troy weight, ⅛ of this
sum, or 92.5562 livres, would be the value of that ounce by which
gold is sold at London.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Paris ounce is about 1½ <i>per cent.</i> lighter than the troy
ounce; and the exact proportion between them is unknown, from
the confusion of weights, and the want of a fixed standard in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the best calculation I have been able to make, a Paris ounce
should contain 473 grains troy, which makes the proportion between
the two ounces to be as 473 is to 480, which is the number of grains
in the troy ounce.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gold bullion at Paris is regulated by the mark <i>fine</i>, at London by
the ounce <em>standard</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>When standard gold bullion is at the lowest price it can be at London,
it is worth the mint price, or 3<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i> <i>per</i> troy ounce, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>expressed in decimals, is 3.8937<i>l.</i> sterling. Standard is to fine, as 11
is to 12; consequently, the ounce fine is 4.2476<i>l.</i> sterling: and if
the Paris ounce of <em>fine</em> bullion be worth, as has been said, 92.5562
livres, the ounce troy, according to the above proportion, will be
worth 93.926 livres. Divide then the livres by the sterling money,
and the quotient will give you the real par of exchange of the
pound sterling, while bullion remains at that value in Paris and in
London, viz. <sup>4.2476</sup>⁄<sub>93.926</sub> = 22.112 livres for the pound, or 32.56<i>d.</i> sterling
for the French crown of 3 livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gold bullion never can rise in the Paris market, at least all the
last war it never <em>did</em> rise, above the value of the coin; that is, to
801.6 livres the mark fine, or 100.2 livres <i>per</i> ounce Paris, and 101.7
livres the troy ounce.</p>

<p class='c001'>How high the price of gold bullion may rise at London no man
can say; but the highest it rose to, during the last war, was, I believe,
4<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> <i>per</i> ounce standard, or to 4.3999<i>l.</i> sterling <i>per</i>
ounce fine. By this divide the value of the ounce troy fine in French
livres, the real par at this rate of the metals in both cities will be
<sup>4.3999</sup>⁄<sub>101.7</sub> = 23.11 livres for the pound sterling, or 31.155 pence sterling
for the French crown of 3 livres. But suppose two cases which
may happen, viz. 1. That gold bullion at Paris should be at the
price of coin, while at London it may be at mint price: or, 2. That
at Paris it may be at mint price, when at London it is at 4<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
what will then the real par of exchange be?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that on the first supposition, it will be one pound sterling,
equal to 23.939 livres, and the crown of 3 livres equal to 30.076
pence sterling. In the other, equal to 21.34 livres for the pound
sterling, and for the crown of 3 livres 33.728. A difference of no
less than 8.9 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not evident that these variations <em>must</em> occur in the exchange
between London and Paris? And is it not also plain, that they proceed
from the fluctuation of the price of bullion, not from exchange?</p>

<p class='c001'>We have, I think, demonstrated, in the third book, that a wrong
balance upon the French trade raises bullion to the price of coin;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and that a right balance brings it down to mint price. The price
of coinage is above 8 <i>per cent.</i> So that 8 <i>per cent.</i> of fluctuation in
the price of bullion is easily accounted for in the Paris market, without
combining the variations in the English market.</p>

<p class='c001'>In London, where no coinage is paid, were all the coin of full
weight, and exportation free, coin and standard bullion would constantly
stand at the same price: but when the heavy coin is exported,
and the currency becomes light by the old remaining in circulation,
the price of bullion rises in proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it surprizing that, at London, gold in bullion should be worth
as much as gold of the same standard in guineas, weight for weight?
It is worth as much at the mint, why should it not be worth as
much at market? Any man may offer to pay <em>for the ounce</em> of all the
guineas coined by Charles II. James II. and William III. now in circulation,
the highest market price that ever was given for standard
gold bullion in London, and gain by the bargain.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, I hope, will be sufficient to satisfy any body that there is a
mistake in ascribing the high price paid for the French crown in the
London exchange, to a wrong balance upon the trade of England
with France.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this new light in which I have placed the question, I hope
the arguments used in the 16th chapter of the first part of the third
book, will acquire an additional force; and that thereby the eyes
of this nation may be opened with regard to the interests of the
French trade; a point, I should think, of the highest concern.</p>

<p class='c001'>To calculate, as every body does, the par of the French crown, either
by the gold or the silver in the English <em>standard</em> coin, when no such
<em>standard</em> coin exists; and to state all that is given for the crown above
29½<i>d.</i> if you reckon by the silver, or 30¼<i>d.</i> if you reckon by the
gold, for the price of a wrong balance, is an error which may lead
to the most fatal consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>If government should think fit to impose, in their own mint, a
coinage, equal to that of France, and make all their coin of equal
weight, and at the due proportion, it will take off all the loss we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>suffer by paying coinage to France, which we at present impute to
the exchange, while she pays none to us. But then it will occasion
nearly the same fluctuations upon the real par of exchange as at
present; only from another cause on the side of Great Britain. At
present our exchange becomes favourable from the weight of our
own currency, and the balance against France upon her trade;
which, in Paris, raises the price of the bullion with which we pay
our French debts. On the other hand, our exchange becomes unfavourable
from the lightness of our own currency, from the coinage
we pay to France, and balance against us; which last carries off
all our new guineas; and in the Paris market, sinks the value of
that bullion in which we pay our French debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were matters put upon a right footing, we should gain from
France the price of our coinage, when our balance is favourable,
and pay coinage to France when their balance is favourable; instead
of seeing our exchange turn more in our favour, only from
the additional weight of the coin in which we pay.</p>

<p class='c001'>If French coinage should appear too high a price for the interest of
other branches of British trade, a question I shall not here determine,
let us impose at least as much as to keep our guineas out of
the melting pot, and banish all the old coin which throws us into
such confusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has been said is undoubtedly too much upon this subject
for the generality of readers. The number of those who can go
through a chapter like this with pleasure is very small. But if the
idea I have been endeavouring to communicate, be found just by
one man of capacity, whose opinion shall have weight in the deliberations
of Great Britain, the consequences may be great to this
nation; and this consideration will, I hope, plead my excuse.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now set this question in another point of view, from which
the stress of my arguments will be felt, and all intricate combinations
will be laid aside.</p>

<p class='c001'>Does not the price of exchange, or what is given above the par,
proceed from the expence of sending the metals from one place to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>the other, the insurance of them, and the exchanger’s profit? If
this be true, which I believe no body will deny, must not what is
paid for the bill, over and above these three articles, be considered
as the real par, relative to exchange? Now does the price of the
bullion which the exchanger pays in his own market, or the price
he gets for that bullion in the market to which he sends it, at all
enter into the account of the transportation, risk, and profit, which
the exchanger has on the operation? Certainly not. May there not
be a very great difference between the buying and selling the very same
bullion in different markets at one time and another? Ought
we not to charge that to some other accompt than to the price of
exchange, which is confined to the expence of transporting <em>the balance
only</em>, and when two objects totally different are included under
the same term, does it not tend to perplex our notions concerning
them?</p>

<p class='c001'>The great variation in the price of bullion in France, for example,
and the expence of procuring it, proceeds from three causes. The
first is, the coinage imposed in France, while none is imposed in
England. What, therefore, is paid upon this account, is profit to
France, and loss to England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second cause of variation, is the debasement of the value of
the pound sterling, when the heavy gold has been sent abroad.
That loss affects the nation, and every man in England, in the quality
of creditor for sums specified in pounds sterling, to the profit
of all debtors.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third cause of variation, is from the great expence exchangers
are put to, in procuring the metals from other countries, when they
cannot be got at home: the consequence of this shall be explained
in a succeeding chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>As all these causes are combined in the exchange upon bills when
they come to market, I think it is proper to analize them, before
the doctrine we are upon can be distinctly understood.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall therefore conclude my chapter with this proposition:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>That the best method of determining exactly the true and intrinsic
value of the metals, coin, or money, in which the balance due to
or from a foreign nation is to be paid, is to compare the respective
value of fine bullion with the respective denominations of the coin
in the one and the other; and to state the difference as the price
paid for the exchange<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. There occurs another considerable difficulty to be removed, before the real par of
exchange can be exactly determined from the price of bullion, to wit, the uncertainty
of weights, and the multiplicity of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every nation in Europe has a different weight, I might almost say every city. This
has proceeded, in a great measure, from the inaccuracy with which they have been
made formerly. I think it is highly probable, that many, at least, of the principal
weights in Europe, have derived their origin from the same standard; although they
are now considerably different. Those I am best acquainted with are the following, of
which I shall here set down a short table, reduced to troy grains, according to the best
calculation I have been able to make.</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='71%' />
<col width='28%' />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>One ounce troy contains</td>
    <td class='c019'>480 troy grains.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>One ounce Paris, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>poids de marc</i></span>,</td>
    <td class='c019'>473</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>One ounce Holland troes</td>
    <td class='c019'>473.27</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>One ounce Colonia</td>
    <td class='c019'>449.33</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c001'>These are the weights used in the mints of England, France, Holland, and Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'>If therefore we should call the troy ounce 100, the proportion of the rest will be as
follows:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='71%' />
<col width='28%' />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>Troy</td>

    <td class='c011'>Holland</td>
    <td class='c019'> 98.597</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>Colonia</td>
    <td class='c019'> 93.61</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c001'>I have chosen to reduce to ounces; because it is the denomination in which the proportion
of weights is best preserved.</p>

<p class='c001'>These ounces I apprehend to have been originally taken from the old Roman pound,
which was the weight adopted by the Emperor Charles the Great, who applied himself
much to the establishing a general standard of weights in his dominions.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the examples I have given, we see how the Colonia ounce deviates more than any
other from the average on the whole.</p>

<p class='c001'>This ounce is very near equal to the old Saxon ounce, established in the English
mint at the Norman conquest, and there preserved, until Henry VIII. substituted
in its place, the troy weight. This circumstance makes it probable that the Saxon
ounce came originally from Charles the Great, who first conquered the Saxon nation,
and drew them from a state of absolute barbarity. The rude manners of the Saxons
may have occasioned this great deviation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference, therefore, in those ounces, I ascribe to the progressive error of those
who have made weights, and from the neglect of preserving a proper standard.</p>

<p class='c001'>The best remedy for this inconvenience, would be, for any one mint to form a
weight, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad libitum</i></span>, and to send a most accurate copy of it to every mint in Europe: to
mention, at the same time, the exact proportion between the weight sent, and that observed
at their own mint: to beg of the other mints an equal communication of the
proportion between the weight sent, and their several standards: and last of all, to publish
in the news-papers of all commercial towns, every market day, as is done at Amsterdam,
the price of <i>fine</i> gold and silver, according to this new weight made for the
purpose. This weight may be called the mint-weight of Europe; and from the universal
utility which would follow upon such a regulation, it probably might be followed:
were this to happen, it might be a step towards establishing an universal conformity of
weights every where.</p>

<p class='c001'>While matters stand on the present footing, it is necessary to be informed of three
particulars. First, Of the proportion of the different mint weights. Secondly, Of
the regulations by which the coin is made. And lastly, Of the exactness of the mints
in following the regulation. Every mistake in any one of these three articles, is an
impediment to the just determination of the real par.</p>

<p class='c001'>I acknowledge that, in fact, exchange business goes on smoothly, notwithstanding
all the difficulties we have been enumerating. It may therefore be asked, in what
would consist the great advantage of so scrupulous a nicety?</p>

<p class='c001'>My answer is, that exchange business will always go smoothly on, as long as
exchangers gain, and that trade is not interrupted.</p>

<p class='c001'>But trading men consider their own interest only; and I am configuring the interest
of an intelligent state, which wants to promote the good of the whole community, without
occasioning any hurt to the interest of individuals.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.3.3' class='c015'>CHAP. III. <br /> <i>How to remove the inconveniences which occur in paying Balances with the Metals or Coin of a Nation.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The inconveniences which occur when balances are to be paid
in bullion or coin are these:</p>

<p class='c001'>First, The want of secure and ready transportation, from the obstructions
government throws in the way to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, The difficulty of procuring the metals abroad when
they are not to be found at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we speak here of balances to be paid from one country to
another, we understand, that the general amount of the whole
payments to be made to the world, exceeds the sum of all that is
reciprocally due from it. So far as a balance due to one country
is compensated with a balance due by another, they may be mutually
discharged by bills of exchange, according to the principles
already laid down. All compensations being made by bills drawn for
reciprocal debts, we must here suppose a balance due by the country
whose interest we are considering. This, like debts between private
people, must either be paid in intrinsic value, or by security
for it; that is, by contracting a permanent debt bearing interest.
The first is the question here before us; the second will be examined
in the succeeding chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first difficulty mentioned, to wit, the want of secure and
ready transportation of the metals, proceeds in a great measure from
the obstruction government throws in the way, to prevent the exportation
of them. To remove which difficulty, it is proper to shew
how far it is the interest of government to obstruct, how far to accelerate
the transportation of the metals.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said that it is the advantage of every state, in point of
trade, to have balances paid with the least expence. If then we
suppose that it is either necessary or expedient that this balance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>should be paid in the metals, government, in that case, should
facilitate by every method the sending them off in the cheapest and
securest way.</p>

<p class='c001'>But since governments do not follow that rule, we must examine
the reasons which engage them to prefer a contrary conduct.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principal, the most general, and most rational objection
against the exportation of the metals, is, that when it is permitted,
without restriction, it engages the people, when they go to foreign
markets for articles of <a id='corr326.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='exportation'>importation</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_326.9'><ins class='correction' title='exportation'>importation</ins></a></span>, to run to the coin, instead of
carrying thither the product and manufactures of the country.
From which a consequence is drawn, that as long as coin and bullion
are fairly allowed to be exported, the rich inhabitants will
employ them for the purchase of foreign commodities, to the hurt
of domestic industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is an objection of great weight, relative to the situation of
many nations. The Spaniards and Portuguese feel it severely.
Many individuals there are very rich; the numerous classes of the
people are either lazy or not properly bred to industry. In that
situation the alternative to government is very disagreeable. Either
the rich must be deprived of every enjoyment with which their
industrious neighbours alone can supply them, until, by very slow
degrees, the lowest classes of their countrymen can be engaged to
change their way of living, and be inspired with a spirit of industry;
or they must be allowed to gratify the desires which riches
create, at the expence of the nation’s treasure, and the improvement
of their country.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this alternative we discover the principle which directs the
conduct of a statesman under such circumstances, viz.</p>

<p class='c001'>To forbid the importation of every foreign manufacture whatsoever;
to submit to the hardships necessarily implied in the circumstances
of the nation; and to pay freely what balance may be owing
upon natural produce imported for the uses of subsistence, or
manufacture.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a plan more rational and more easily executed, than a general
prohibition to export the metals; because with good regulations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>properly executed, you may prevent the importation of manufactures;
but it is hardly possible to prevent the exportation of
the metals necessary to pay for what you have bought from strangers,
by the permission of government: and on the other hand,
suppose you do effectually prevent the exportation of the metals,
the consequence will be, to put an end to all foreign trade even in
natural produce. What nation will trade with another who can pay
only by barter? All credit will then be cut off; for who will exchange
by bills, with a place which cannot pay, either in their
own currency, or with the metals, the debts which they reciprocally
owe?</p>

<p class='c001'>The maxim therefore, here, is to prevent the contracting of debts
with strangers; but when you allow them to be contracted, to facilitate
the payment of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This reasoning is only calculated to direct a statesman who finds
himself at the head of a rich luxurious nobility, and an idle or ill
instructed common people, surrounded by industrious neighbours,
whose assistance may be necessary upon many occasions, to provide
subsistence, or the materials of manufacture, to his people; and
this while he is forming a scheme of introducing industry at home,
as a basis for afterwards establishing a proper foreign commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in this subject combinations are infinite, and the smallest
change of circumstances throws the decision of a question on a different
principle.</p>

<p class='c001'>I will not therefore say, that in every case which can be supposed,
certain restrictions upon the exportation of bullion or coin
are contrary to good policy. This proposition I confine to the flourishing
trading nations of our own time.</p>

<p class='c001'>To set this matter in a fair light, and as an exercise upon principles,
I shall borrow two combinations, one from history, and another
from a recent example in France, in which a clog upon the
exportation of the metals and coin were very politically laid on.</p>

<p class='c001'>We learn from the history of Henry VII. of England, a sagacious
Prince, that he established very severe laws against the exportation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>of bullion; and obliged the merchants who imported foreign commodities
into his dominions, to invest their returns in the natural
produce of England, which at that time consisted principally in
wool and in grain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The circumstances of the times in which that Prince lived, must
therefore be examined, before we can justly find fault with this step
of his political oeconomy.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Henry the VIIth’s time, the foreign trade of England was entirely
in the hands of foreigners, and almost every elegant manufacture
came from abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under such circumstances, is it not plain, that the prohibition of
the exportation of bullion and coin was only a compulsion, concomitant
with other regulations, to oblige foreign merchants,
residing in his kingdom, to buy up the superfluity of the English
natural produce of wool and grain? Had not the King taken those
measures, the whole money of the nation would have been exported;
the superfluous natural produce of England would have
lain upon hand; the abundance of these would have brought their
price below the value of the subsistence of those who produced
them; agriculture would have been abandoned; and the nation
would have been undone.</p>

<p class='c001'>I allow that nothing is so absurd as a desire to consume foreign
productions, and to forbid the exportation of the price of them. I
also allow, that every restraint laid upon exporting silver and gold,
falls upon the consumer of foreign goods, and obliges him to pay
the dearer for them; but this additional expence to the consumer,
does not augment the mass of foreign debts. The debt due abroad
will constantly be paid with the same quantity of coin, whether the
exportation of it be allowed or forbidden; because the loss of those
who pay the balance arises from the risk of confiscation of the money
they want to export against law; or from the high exchange
they are obliged to pay to those who take that risk upon themselves.
In both cases, the additional expence they are put to remains in the
country, and is repaid them by the consumers; consequently, can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>never occasion one farthing more to be exported. Prohibitions,
therefore, upon the exportation of specie, are not in every case so
absurd as they appear at first sight. It is very certain that no body
gives money for nothing; consequently, a state may rest assured
that the proprietors of the specie, their subjects, will take sufficient
care not to make a present of it to foreigners. The intention,
therefore, of such prohibitions, is not to prevent the payment of
what people owe; but to prevent that payment from being made in
coin or bullion; and also to discourage the buying of such foreign
commodities as must be paid in specie, preferably to others which
may be paid for with the returns of home produce.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a statesman, therefore, finds the balance of trade, upon
the main, favourable to the country he governs, he need give himself
no trouble about the exportation of the specie, from this single
principle, to wit, that he is sure it is not given for nothing. But
when the balance turns against them, in the regular course of business,
not from a temporary cause, then he may lay restraints upon
the exportation of specie, as a concomitant restriction, together
with others, in order to diminish the general mass of importations,
and thereby to set the balance even.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a trading nation, I allow, that no restriction of that kind ought
to be general; because it then affects the useful and the hurtful
branches of importation equally: but in Henry’s days, the sale of
corn and wool was sufficient to procure for England all it wanted from
abroad; and the interests of trade were not sufficiently combined,
to enable the state to act by any other than the most general rules.
Forbidding the exportation of coin was found to promote the exportation
of English productions, and this was a sufficient reason
for making the prohibition peremptory. In this view of the matter,
did not Henry judge well, when he obliged the merchants who
imported foreign goods, to invest the price they received for them
in English commodities? Once more I must say it, he was not so
much afraid of the consequences of the money going out, as of the
corn and wool remaining at home; had he been sure of the exportation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of these articles to as good purpose another way, the prohibition
would have been absurd; but I am persuaded that was not
the case.</p>

<p class='c001'>The example taken from France is this.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the fatal bankruptcy in 1720, by the blowing up of the
Missisippi, the trade of France languished from the effects of the
instability of their coin, until the year 1726, when it was set upon
that footing on which it has remained ever since.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon that last general coinage, the same principles of enriching
the King by the operation, directed the conduct of the minister.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old specie was cried down, and proscribed in circulation:
but it was thought, that as it was the King’s coin, he had a liberty
to set a price upon it, at a different rate from any other bullion of
the same fineness; and that he had also a right to command the
proprietors of it to bring it to the mint at his own price.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence was, that those who could were very desirous
to send it to Holland, in order to draw back the value they had sent
in bills upon Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under such circumstances, were not prohibitions upon the exportation
of this coin most consistent with the plan laid down? We
shall, in the next chapter, examine the consequences of this operation
upon the exchange of France.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has been said, will, I hope, suffice to explain some of the
principal motives which statesmen may have, when they lay restrictions
on the exportation of the metals, with a view to favour the
trade of their nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>But besides the interests of trade, there are other reasons for laying
prohibitions on the exportation of the national coin, although
that of bullion be left free under certain restrictions.</p>

<p class='c001'>As often as it happens, from whatever cause it may proceed, that
the value of a nation’s coin falls to par with bullion of the same
fineness, that coin, if exported, may be melted down. This is a
loss; because it puts the nation to the expence of coining more for
the use of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>When nations give coinage gratis, or when they allow the coin
of other nations the privilege of passing current under denominations
exactly proportioned to its intrinsic value, then coin never can
be worth more than any other bullion of the same standard; consequently,
will be exported or smuggled out upon every occasion.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, a nation does really desire to avoid an expence to
the mint, they must make it the interest of merchants to export
every other thing preferably to their own coin. This is done by
imposing a duty upon the coinage; and this will either prevent its
going out unnecessarily, or if it be necessary to export it, the coin
will return in the payments made to the nation, in consequence of
its advanced value above any other bullion which can be sent.</p>

<p class='c001'>The forbidding the exportation of coin, implies a restriction upon
the exportation of bullion; because, unless the bullion be examined
at the custom house, and the stamps upon it looked at, it may happen
to be nothing but the nation’s coin melted down, with an intention
to avoid the law. For this reason, whoever brings bullion
to be stamped, whether it be for exportation or not, must declare
that it is not made of the nation’s coin. How slender a check are
all such declarations! The only one effectual is private interest; and
as no man will take his wig to stuff his chair, when he can get
cheaper materials equally good, so no man will melt down coin
which bears an advanced value, when he can procure any other
bullion.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, we may determine, that a flourishing commercial
state, which has, on the average of their trade, a balance coming
in from other countries, should lay it down as a general rule, to
facilitate the exportation of their coin, as well as bullion: and if a
very particular circumstance should occur, which may continue for
a short time, they may then put a temporary stop to it, and facilitate
the payment of the balance in the way of credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have enlarged so much upon the methods of removing the first
difficulty of paying a balance, with the coin or bullion found in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>nation, that what remains to be said upon the second difficulty, to
wit, the procuring them from other nations, need not be long.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were the mint weights of all countries sufficiently determinate;
were the regulations concerning the standard of bullion exactly
complied with; and were the current market prices of that important
commodity, considered as a valuable piece of intelligence every
where, the bullion trade would be much easier than it is.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said, that when the reciprocal debts of two nations are
equal, there is no occasion for bullion to discharge them. But
trading nations are many; and from this it may happen, that one
who, upon the whole, is creditor to the world, may be debtor to a
place which is also creditor to the world; and in this case bullion
is necessary to pay the debt.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a man owes money to a person who has many creditors, the
person owing, may buy up a claim against him, and pay what he
owes in that way: but if the person to whom he owes money be
indebted to no body, then the debt must be paid with ready money.
Just so of nations. For instance, when bullion is demanded to be
exported to Holland, the English merchants, who are creditors on
Spain and Portugal, take from thence their returns in bullion, for
the sake of paying a balance to Holland, which is, upon the whole,
creditor to the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as it seldom happens, that he who deals with Holland is
the person who has credit in Spain or Portugal, he is obliged to
apply to Portugal merchants to procure bullion. They again who
trade thither, having profit on the returns of the commodities
they bring from thence, will expect the same profits upon the
bills they give to the man who wants to take his return in bullion.
This plainly raises the price of bullion in the English market; because
it is brought home in consequence of a demand from England.
On the other hand, when the demands of England for Portuguese
commodities is less than the value of what Portugal owes
her, the Portugal merchants in London are obliged to take the balance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>in the metals. These come to the London market, and are
offered to sale to those who want them: then the price of bullion
falls; because the demand comes from the other side.</p>

<p class='c001'>To go through all the operations which merchants employ to
abbreviate the process I have been describing, would, indeed, better
explain the practical part of exchange, than what I have said; but I
write, not to instruct merchants, but to extract from their complicated
operations, the principles upon which they are founded.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.3.4' class='c015'>CHAP. IV. <br /> <i>How the Price of Exchange</i>, in a prosperous trading Nation, <i>may be prevented from operating upon the whole Mass of reciprocal Payments, in place of affecting the Balance only</i>.</h4>

<p class='c016'>We have taken it for granted, that the price of exchange is a
hurt to trade in general.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this chapter, we shall inquire more particularly than we have
done, in what that hurt consists. The point of view of every man,
whether he be a merchant or not, is first honestly, and as far as law
and fair dealing permit, to consult his own private interest; and
in the second place, to promote that interest with which his own is
most closely connected.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to this rule, every merchant will endeavour to manage
his exchange business to the best advantage to himself. If the balance
be against his country, he will sell his bills <a id='corr333.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to'>on</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_333.23'><ins class='correction' title='to'>on</ins></a></span> the country
creditor as dear as he can; that is, he will endeavour to raise the
price of exchange as high as he can against his country, whatever
hurt may thereby result to the general trade of it; and in so doing,
he only does what duty to himself requires; because it is by minding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>his business only, that he can trade upon equal terms with his
neighbours, every one of which avail themselves of the like fluctuations,
when they happen to be in their favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this I conclude, that since the loss upon high exchange
against a country, affects principally the cumulative interest of the
whole, relative to other trading nations; it is the business of the
statesman, not of the merchants, to provide a remedy against it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole class of merchants, no doubt, exchangers excepted,
would be very glad to find the course of exchange constantly at par.
This is also greatly the interest of the state; because it is from the
<em>balance</em> in its favour, not from <em>the profit made in drawing that balance</em>
from the debtor, that the state is a gainer. This must be explained.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am to shew how it happens, that a nation is only benefited or
hurt by the net balance which it receives from, or pays to her
neighbours: and that the whole expence of paying or receiving
that balance, is not national, but particular to individuals at home;
consequently, it would be the interest of all states, that balances,
both favourable and unfavourable, were paid by the nation debtor,
at the least expence possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great difficulty in communicating one’s thoughts upon this
subject with distinctness, proceeds from the ambiguity of the terms
necessary to express them. This may be avoided by adopting the
technical terms of merchants; but these are still more difficult to
be comprehended by any one not conversant in commerce. I shall
acquit myself of this difficult talk the best way I can.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we speak of a balance between two nations, we shall call
the nation who owes the balance the <em>nation-debtor</em>; the other to
whom it is owing, the <em>nation-creditor</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Balances imply reciprocal debts; consequently, reciprocal debtors
and creditors. To avoid, therefore, confusion in this particular, we
shall use four expressions, viz. the debtors to the nation-creditor;
the debtors to the nation-debtor; the creditors to the nation-creditor;
the creditors to the nation-debtor.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Let me suppose that Paris owes a balance to London, no matter
for what sum. The reciprocal debts between Paris and London are
all affected by the consequence of this balance: that is to say, some
pay or receive more than the real par; some pay or receive less.
To discover where the profit centers, we are now to inquire who
are those who receive more, who are those who receive less. And
as profit and loss are here only relative, that is to say, the profit of
the one is compensated by the loss of the other; we must see whether
or not, upon the whole, the price of the exchange in this case
be favourable to London, to which, by the supposition, the balance
is due, and unfavourable to Paris, which is the debtor.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question thus stated, let us examine the operations of exchange
at London and Paris, and the state of demand in both, for
money or bills.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the London market, the demand will be for money in London
for bills on Paris; and he who demands, must pay the exchange;
consequently, the London merchants, creditors to the <em>nation-debtor</em>,
will pay the exchange; that is to say, they will sell their bills on
Paris below par; and the London merchants, debtors to the nation-debtor,
will buy them, and gain the exchange; that is, they will
buy bills upon Paris below par.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now as this negotiation is carried on at London, I must suppose
it to take place amongst Englishmen; one part of whom will gain
exactly what the other loses; consequently England, in this respect,
neither gains or loses by the exchange paid in London.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine the interest of the merchants, and the interest
of the nation’s trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>The creditors to the nation-debtor, who have lost by the exchange,
are those who have exported English commodities to France. Upon
this profitable branch of commerce the exchange occasions a loss,
the consequence of which is, to discourage exportation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The debtors to the nation-debtor, who have gained by the exchange,
are those who have imported French commodities to England.
Upon this hurtful branch of commerce, the exchange occasions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>a profit; the consequence of which is, to encourage importation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is not all. The merchants exporters, who have lost, cannot
draw back their loss upon the return of their trade; because
the return of their trade is the <em>money</em> due by France, the balance
included. Whereas the merchants importers may draw back their
loss upon the return of their trade; because that return is <em>merchandize</em>,
which they can sell so much the dearer to their own countrymen.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the balance be in favour of London, importers gain, as we
have seen; when it is otherwise, and when they are obliged to pay
the exchange, they indemnify themselves, by the sale of their
goods so much the dearer. High exchange, therefore, <em>may</em> hurt
exporters, but never <em>can</em> hurt importers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine the operation of exchange at Paris.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Paris market, the demand will be for bills upon London
for money in Paris; and he who demands must pay the exchange.
The debtors, therefore, to the nation-creditor, must pay the exchange,
and the creditors to the nation-creditor will receive it; and
as both are Frenchmen, the profit and loss to Paris exactly balance
one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the debtors to the nation-creditor are here the importers of
English goods; consequently, this trade, hurtful to France, would
be hurtful to the importer, could he not indemnify himself by selling
them so much the dearer to his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The creditors, again, to the nation-creditor, who gain the exchange,
are the exporters of French goods to England; so that here
the exportation meets with an encouragement from a balance against
the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the advantage found upon exchange in favour of exporters,
and the loss upon it to the prejudice of importers, in the case of a
wrong balance, it has been believed, that a wrong balance produced
upon importations and exportations are effects equal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>contrary, which destroy one another, and thereby bring the balance
even.</p>

<p class='c001'>In answer to this, I have two short arguments to offer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first is, that were the argument conclusive, it would hold
good in reversing the proposition; to wit, that the consequence of
a favourable balance would be to destroy the difference also, and
bring the balance even. This I never heard alleged.</p>

<p class='c001'>My second argument is the strongest: that the enhancing of the
prices of importations will not so effectually discourage the sale of
them at home, as the enhancing the prices of exportations will discourage
the sale of them abroad; for the reasons I shall give presently.
But in the mean time,</p>

<p class='c001'>If the compensation be considered only in relation to the merchants
importers and exporters, there, indeed, I agree, that <em>their</em>
profit and loss upon the exchange is most exactly balanced; because
what the one party gains the other loses; and the country loses the
balance only, as has been said.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reciprocal debts thus transacted by bills of exchange, we
see that no profit can be made, nor loss incurred, either to London,
or Paris, by that operation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The profit to Frenchmen is compensated by the loss to Frenchmen;
the same may be said of the English merchants: but the
balance due after those operations are over, and the more remote
consequences of high exchange, affect the relative interest of the
two nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>This balance is generally sent by the country-debtor, either to
the country-creditor, or to their order in a third country, to which
they are indebted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The transportation and insurance of this balance is an expence to
those who owe it, and the profit, if any there be on that operation,
naturally falls to exchangers of the same nation, who conduct it.
So whether exchange be paid upon bills drawn, or expence be incurred
in the transportation of balances, no profit can accrue upon
that to the nation-creditor, to the detriment of the debtor: it must,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>therefore, do hurt to both, relatively to nations where, upon the
average of trade, exchange is lower.</p>

<p class='c001'>I come now to the method of transporting balances in the
metals.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how the creditors of the nation-debtor pay exchange
upon the sale of their bills on Paris, which owes the balance. If
by the operations of exchangers, this exchange should rise, to their
detriment, higher than the expence, trouble, and insurance, of
bringing the balance from Paris, then they will appoint some factor
at Paris, to whose order they will draw bills upon their debtors in
that city; and as what the Paris-debtors owe to London is stated in
pounds sterling, the London-creditors will value the pound sterling,
according to the rate of exchange, in their favour; and in their
bills upon their Paris-debtor, they will convert the sum into livres,
including the exchange.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this operation, we see how the transportation of the balance
may become the business of the creditors to the nation-debtor: which
is a combination we have not as yet attended to: a few words will
explain it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the creditors of the nation-debtor sell their bills, they must
pay the exchange, as has been said. When they draw bills to the
order of a friend in the place where the balance is owing, they
superadd the exchange. This their debtors pay: but then they
themselves must be at the trouble and expence of bringing home
the money.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is from this alternative which both parties have of either sending
what they owe to their creditors in bullion, or of allowing them
to draw for it at the additional expence of paying the exchange,
that a check upon the extravagant profit of exchangers arises: and
from this combination arises all the delicate operations of drawing
and remitting.</p>

<p class='c001'>Into these we shall not inquire: the principle on which they depend
appears sufficiently plain, and this is the principal object of
our attention.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>I proceed now to consider how far those reciprocal profits and
losses, between merchants in the same country, affect the trade of
it in general.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the balance is favourable, we have said that the exporters
lose the exchange, and the importers gain it; and both being citizens,
the country would not be concerned in their relative interests,
were it not that these interests are connected with that of the country,
which reaps great benefit from the trade of those who deal in
exportations, and loss from the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, exchange is found to hurt exportation, when the
balance is favourable, in this respect the country has an interest in
bringing it as low as possible. But as it may be said that since the
return of an unfavourable balance hurts in its turn the interests of
importation, and favours the other, exchange thereby operates a
national compensation; it will not be improper, in this place, to
throw out one reflection more, in order to destroy the strength of
that argument.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were this proposition admitted, as I am afraid it cannot, from
what we have already said, it affords no argument against doing
what can be done, to render exchange as little hurtful as possible
to exportation, during the favourable balance. But as to the question
itself, of national compensation, I cannot allow that even
<em>exporters</em> and <em>importers</em> are thereby brought on a level in point of
trade: for this reason, that the exchange affecting the exporters, in
proportion as it augments, discourages manufacturers, who must
have regular, and even growing profits, according to the increase of
demand. These the merchant exporter cannot afford; because he
<em>cannot</em> draw back from his foreign correspondents, any advance
upon manufactures at home, arising from domestic circumstances.
But when the merchant importer is affected by the exchange against
him; this additional expence he <em>can</em> draw back; because he sells to
those who are affected by all domestic circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us therefore determine, that it is the interest of a state to disregard
that compensation which is given to exportation by a wrong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>balance, which does so much harm; and to avoid the discouragement
given to it by a right balance, which does so much good.
The only way to compass those ends, is to keep exchange as near
to par as possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could reciprocal debts be always exchanged at par, and could
the expence of bringing home, and sending a balance abroad, be
defrayed by the state, I think it would prove a great advantage to
the trade of a nation. I do not pretend to say that, as matters stand,
the thing is practicable; but as it is a question which relates to my
subject, and seems both curious and interesting, I shall here examine
it.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first sight, this idea will appear chimerical; and some readers
may despise it too much, to be at the trouble to read what may be
said for it. I shall therefore set out by informing them that the
scheme has been tried, in a great kingdom in Europe, under a great
minister; I say it was attempted in France, in the year 1726, under
the administration of Cardinal Fleuri, and produced its effect;
although it was soon given up, from a circumstance which, I think,
never can occur in Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the last general coinage in France, 1726, exchange became
so unfavourable to that kingdom, that there was a general outcry.
The Cardinal, to put a stop to the clamour, and set trade to rights,
as he thought, ordered Samuel Bernard, at that time a man of
great credit, to give bills on Holland at par, to all the merchants.
To enable him to place funds in Amsterdam, for the payment of
his bills, the Cardinal supplied this exchanger with sufficient quantities
of the old coin, then cried down, and paid for the exportation
of it to Holland.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon this exchange on Holland came to par; and all exchangers
at Paris looked on the operation with amazement. The minister,
however, in a short time discovered, that by this he was undoing
with one hand, what he wanted to establish with the other. He
therefore stopped in his career, after having paid, perhaps, ten
times the balance due to Holland.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>By unfolding the combination of this operation, I shall be better
able to cast light on the question before us, than in any other way.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the general coinage was made in France, by the arret of
the month of January 1726, all the old coin was cried down, and
ordered to be recoined. The mint price of fine gold <i>per</i> marc was
fixed at 536 livres 14 sols 6 deniers; and the silver at 37 livres 1 sol
9 deniers. These were the prices at which the mint paid for bullion,
when offered to be coined. But the King, as if he had a right upon
the metal in the old coin, commanded it to be delivered at the mint
at no higher rate than 492 livres for the marc of fine gold, and at
34 livres for the marc of fine silver: and to compel the possessors of
it to bring it in, all exportation and melting down was made
highly penal; the avenues from France were beset with guards to
prevent the going out; and the melting pots were strictly watched.
Upon this, the possessors of the old coin, rather than sell it to the
mint at so great an undervalue, had recourse to exchangers for bills
upon Holland for it: and these being obliged to send it thither at a
great expence and risk, exacted a very high exchange, which, consequently,
affected the whole trade of France.</p>

<p class='c001'>Politicians persuaded the Cardinal, that exchange had got up so
high, not from the discredit cast on the old coin, but because of
the wrong balance, and the alteration which had been made at that
time upon the denomination of the new: and that so soon as the
balance against France was paid, exchange would return to par.
Upon this the Cardinal set Bernard to work, but he soon discovered
his mistake; and by arret of the 15th of June the same year, raised
the mint price of the old coin, and then exchange became favourable.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are all facts mentioned by Dutot, and yet he never will
ascribe the rise of exchange in France to any other cause than to
the tampering with the denominations of their coin: an operation
which may rob one set of people in favour of another; but which
has very little effect upon exchange, when other circumstances do
not concur, as in the case before us.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Now had the high exchange against France been owing to a wrong
balance upon her trade, is it not evident that the Cardinal’s operation
would have succeeded, that all demands for bills at Samuel
Bernard’s office would have been confined to the exact extent of that
balance; that the reciprocal debts would have been negotiated between
the merchants at par; and, consequently, that all expence
upon exchange would have been saved to individuals, at the small
charge to government of transporting the balance paid for the bills
by the merchants at Paris?</p>

<p class='c001'>Were prosperous trading states, therefore, conducted by statesmen,
intelligent, capable, and uninfluenced by motives of private
interest, they would make it a rule to be at the expence of sending off,
and bringing home all balances, without the charge of exchange to
traders: but the consequence of either neglect, or incapacity in the
man at the helm, would then become so fatal that it might be dangerous
to attempt, at once, so great a change in the present method
of paying balances: but I never make allowances for the defects
of a statesman, while I am deducing the principles which ought to
direct his conduct.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall next slightly point out the bad consequences which, <em>upon
an unfavourable state of commerce</em>, might result from such a plan; and
without recommending any thing to practice, leave the reader to
judge of the expediency.</p>

<p class='c001'>We see, that by a statesman’s giving bills at par, <em>on all occasions</em>,
and being himself at the expence of transportation and insurance,
in bringing home and sending off all balances, exchange would of
itself come to par.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first consequence of this would be, the total annihilation of
the exchange business; and if, after that, any interruption should
happen by neglect in the statesman, trade might suffer considerably.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another consequence is, that the most destructive trade would go
forward without a check, as long as merchants could pay the par
of the bills they demanded upon foreign parts: and this they would
constantly be enabled to do, while there was either coin or paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>in circulation, as has been explained in treating of banks of circulation
upon mortgage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence of this would be, to oblige the state to pledge
the revenue of the country to strangers, in proportion to the balance
owing, over and above the extent of the metals to discharge it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the question is, and this I shall leave to the sagacity of my
reader to determine, whether, as matters stand, there be any check
proceeding from high exchange which can prevent the bad consequences
here set forth. I suspect there is not. We see the most
enormous sums lent by nations to nations; raising the exchange
against the lenders; turning it in favour of the borrowers, but
never preventing the loan from going forward. Does not Great
Britain, as well as France, owe amazing sums to other nations, at
the expence of paying the interest out of their revenue? And have
not all those sums been transacted by exchangers, who have made
great fortunes by it? Are not the most unfavourable balances paid
in the ordinary method? Are there not, therefore, already, instruments
in the hands of all nations, sufficient for their undoing?
How could their ruin be accelerated by this alteration in the mode
of performing the same thing?</p>

<p class='c001'>But let it be observed, that our business, in this chapter, is to
search for methods to advance the prosperity of flourishing nations,
who have a balance owing to them; and here we have been setting
forth the bad consequences which result from <em>these</em>, to others who
are in decay. Every argument, therefore, drawn against this
scheme, in favour of the idle or prodigal, is an argument in favour
of it, with respect to the industrious and frugal. As all nations are
liable to alternate vicissitudes of prosperity and adversity, the principles
here laid down require to be carefully combined with domestic
circumstances, before they be applied to practice.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was with a view to this distinction, that, in the title of this
chapter, I pointed out the question there proposed, as relative to the
state of it in a <em>prosperous trading nation</em>; and I am not quite clear how
far it might not be advantageous in every case: but this question I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>shall not here enlarge upon. What has been said, will, I hope, be
sufficient to point out the principles upon which the decision depends;
and if any statesman inclines to try the consequences of
it by an experiment now and then, nothing is so easy as to do it,
without any detriment. This is proved from the operation performed
by the French cardinal, on the occasion of a very unfavourable
and high exchange.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.3.5' class='c015'>CHAP. V. <br /> <i>How, when other expedients prove ineffectual for discharging of Balances, the same may be paid by the Means of Credit, without the Intervention of Coin or Bullion; and who are those who ought to conduct that Operation.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We have now applied the principles formerly laid down, towards
discovering the most proper expedients for removing
or palliating the three inconveniences to be struggled with in regulating
<a id='corr344.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='exchange-property'>exchange</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_344.16'><ins class='correction' title='exchange-property'>exchange</ins></a></span>. 1. How to estimate the value of a balance
due: 2. How to pay it with the coin or bullion of the country:
and lastly, How to prevent the price of exchange from affecting
any thing more than the balance to be paid, after all reciprocal
debts have been compensated.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remains to inquire, what are the most proper methods to acquit
what a nation may owe, after it has done all it can to pay the value
of their balance in the other way.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first sight, it must appear evident that the only method here is
to give security, and pay interest for what cannot be paid in any
other value. This is constantly done by every nation; but as the
ordinary methods are very perplexed, and are attended with expences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>which raise exchange to a great height, and thereby prove
a prodigious discouragement to trade in general: it would be no
small advantage, could all this loss on exchange be equally thrown
upon every class within the state, instead of being thrown entirely
upon its commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>As this is the expedient to be proposed, it will not be amiss to
observe, that foreign balances arise chiefly upon four articles.
1. The great importation and consumption of foreign productions.
2. The payment of debts and interest due to foreigners. 3. The
lending money to other nations. And 4. the great expence of the
state, or of individuals, abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could all the bad consequences arising from these four causes,
and the high exchange occasioned by them, be cast upon that interest
alone which occasions them, I would not propose to lay the
whole body of the nation under contribution for repairing the loss.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if from the nature of the thing, as matters stand, the whole
be found to fall upon trade, without a possibility of preventing it,
in this case, I think, it is better for the nation, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in cumulo</i></span>, to lend its
assistance, and share the burdens, than to allow it to fall upon that
part of the body politic from which the whole draws its vigour
and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It cannot be denied, that when a heavy balance is due by a nation,
it has the effect of raising exchange upon every draught or
remittance. When bills are demanded to pay a foreign claim, it
cannot be determined from what cause the claim has arisen. Whether
for national purposes or not, the exchange is the same, and
equally affects the whole interest of trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this be a fair state of the case, I think we may determine, that
such balances are to be paid by the assistance and intervention of a
statesman’s administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>The object is not so great as at first sight it may appear. We do
not propose that the value of this balance should be advanced by the
state: by no means. They who owe the balance must, as at present,
find a value for the bills they demand. Neither would I propose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>such a plan for any nation who had, upon the average of their
trade, a balance against them; but if, on the whole, the balance
be favourable, I would not, for the sake of saving a little trouble
and expence, suffer the alternate vibrations of exchange to disturb
the uniformity of profits which tends so much to encourage every
branch of commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have abundantly explained the fatal effects of a wrong balance
to banks which circulate paper; and we have shewn how necessary
it is that they should perform what we here recommend.
There is therefore nothing new in this proposal: it is only
carrying the consequences of the same principle one step farther,
by pointing out, as a branch of policy, how government should be
assisting to trade in the payment of balances, where credit abroad
is required; and this assistance should be given out of the public
money.</p>

<p class='c001'>The greatest, and indeed, I think, the only objection to this
scheme, is, that by it the condition of our foreign creditors will be
bettered, for no value received from them. This I allow will be the
case when the balance is against England: but it will be compensated
to the creditors by the loss they will sustain when the balance
is in her favour. But supposing there should be a benefit to foreign
creditors, will not this circumstance raise the confidence of all the
world in the English funds? If there was a proposal made for
lowering the rate of money, by refunding the debts which bear a
higher interest than what money can be procured for, were the
continent to pour her wealth into our subscription, might we not
then more readily expect a supply from that quarter? Besides, is
not all the interest due to foreign creditors paid in bank paper? Is
not this demandable in coin, and will not this coin be exported, if
credit be not found? Were the bank of England to keep a subscription
open, at all times, in Amsterdam, for money to be borrowed
there, on the payment of the interest in that city, who
doubts but loans might be procured at much less expence than at
present, when we beat about for credit every where, until by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>return of a favourable balance upon the trade of England, she shall
be enabled to fill up the void.</p>

<p class='c001'>I feel my own insufficiency to unfold the many combinations
which such an operation must imply. I therefore shall not attempt
what, at any rate, I must leave imperfect. What has been said,
combined with what has been thrown out on the same subject, in
treating of other matters, is sufficient to give a hint, as to the expediency
of the plan in general. And as to the objection which arises
from the payments to the public creditors abroad, I shall reserve
the more ample discussion of it till I come to consider the doctrine
of public credit.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<h4 id='ch4.4.1' class='c020'>CHAP. I. <br /><i>Of the various Consequences of Public Debts.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>The principles which influence the doctrine of public credit
are so few, and so plain, that it is surprising to see how circumstances
could possibly involve them in the obscurity into which
we find them plunged on many occasions.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the better clearing the way towards the main object, I shall
shew, from experience, and from the progress of public credit in
some nations, that the true principles have been overlooked, and
confounded so with extraneous objects, as to be entirely lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>The true method of decyphering, as it were, the complicated
operations of statesmen with respect to this branch, is to bring
back to their native simplicity such plans of administration, as,
from the infinite perplexity of them, make people believe, that
the principles which influence this district of science lie so involved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>as to require a peculiar force of genius even to comprehend
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>By proceeding in this plain track, and by keeping the principles
constantly in view, the most perplexed systems of borrowing, funding,
stock-jobbing, coining and re-coining of money, changing the
weight, fineness, and denominations of specie, circulating paper
in conjunction with it, imposing upon mankind with bubbles and
bankruptcies, and calling them operations of public credit, may
be rendred intelligible to the most slender capacity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many of these topics have been already explained, and dismissed.
This will enable us to contract the plan of what remains in proportion
to the objects it is to comprehend.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public credit we have defined to be, the confidence reposed in a
state, or body politic, borrowing money, on condition that the
capital shall not be demandable, but that a certain proportional
part of the sum shall be annually paid, either in lieu of interest,
or in extinction of part of the capital; for the security of which payment,
a permanent annual fund is appropriated, with a liberty,
however, to the state to set itself free, by repaying the whole,
when nothing to the contrary is stipulated.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this definition I have put in an alternative, of paying a perpetual
interest for the money borrowed, or of paying annually a
sum exceeding the interest; which excess is intended to extinguish
the capital in a certain number of years. In both cases, the annual
payment is called an annuity. When it is exactly equal to the
interest agreed on, it is called perpetual; and determinate, when
granted either for life, or for a certain number of years.</p>

<p class='c001'>The solidity of this security is essential to the borrowing upon
the cheapest terms: let me suppose it to be as solid as land-property,
and as permanent as government itself: what will the consequence
be?</p>

<p class='c001'>If we suppose government to go on in increasing, every year, the
sum of their debts upon perpetual annuities, and appropriating,
in proportion, every branch of revenue for the payment of them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>the consequence will be, in the first place, to transport, in favour
of the creditors, the whole income of the state, of which government
will retain the administration. The farther consequences of
this revolution will furnish matter for a chapter by itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the borrowings of a state be only in proportion to the extinction
of the old capitals, or of what I have called determinate annuities,
then the debts will not increase.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a statesman, therefore, establishes a system of public credit,
the first object which should fix his attention is to calculate
how far the constitution of the state, and its internal circumstances,
render it expedient to throw the revenue of it into the hands of a
money’d interest. I say, this is the most important object of his
deliberation; because the solidity of his credit depends upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, all the interests of the state duly considered, that of trade
be found to predominate, less inconvenience will be found in allowing
the money’d interest to swell: but in monarchies, where
the landed interest is the most powerful, it would be dangerous to
erect so formidable a rival to it. In political bodies every separate
interest will consult its own; and in the contest between those who
pay, and those who receive the taxes, under the denomination of
creditors, the security of public credit becomes precarious.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we may conclude, 1<i>mo</i>, That in governments where
the swelling of a money’d interest is found to threaten the tranquillity
of the state, care should be taken either to establish a sinking
fund, for paying off, in times of peace, what may have been
borrowed in times of war, or the plan of borrowing upon determinate
annuities must be established.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, If natural causes be left to work their own effects, without
a systematical plan of borrowing, the consequence will be a bankruptcy,
and a total failure of public credit, at least for some time.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, If a state should find the mass of their debts to amount to
so great a sum as to be insupportable, they might have recourse
to a total, or partial abolition of them by an act of power.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>4<i>to</i>, If they allow their debts to swell without limitation, and adhere
to the faith of their engagements, the whole property of the
state will be in constant circulation, from one class of men to
another.</p>

<p class='c001'>5<i>to</i>, If the debts contracted be the property of foreigners, these
will either remove into the country, where their funds arise, or
the property, that is, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominium utile</i></span> of the country, will be
transferred from the natives.</p>

<p class='c001'>These and many other combinations will arise from the extension
of public credit; and an examination of the most natural consequences
upon every supposition, will be the best way to acquire
a distinct idea of the subject in general. To pretend to foretell any
one certain chain of consequences, which may, in fact, result from
any combination, is, I apprehend, impossible; because every one
of them will depend upon circumstances totally unknown. These,
in our way of examining matters of this kind, are all to be founded
upon supposition. To supply therefore, in some measure, this
defect, I shall first have recourse to examples of what has happened
in the hitherto infant state of public credit; and as to cases which
have not as yet taken place, we must have recourse to ingenuity,
and endeavour to form the most rational combinations we can.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.4.2' class='c015'>CHAP. II. <br /> <i>Of the Rise and Progress of Public Credit.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>While the policy of Princes directed them to form treasures,
there was no occasion for public credit. This policy prevailed
until the rise of the Roman empire. Then all the treasures
of the world were plundered, and nations were inslaved. On this
revolution, the exigencies of that great empire were supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>from the annual tributes paid by conquered nations. Under good
reigns, this annual supply swelled the public treasure, until a prodigal
Emperor squandered it away; and took to rapine and extortion,
to fill up the void.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the total dissolution of that great empire, Europe was overrun
by barbarous nations, who, with as little industry as ever,
supported their power by the military services of the whole people.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the establishment of the feudal kingdoms under their
chiefs who first laid the foundation of them, arose the Barons, or
principal vassals, who, in imitation of their chief, erected small
principalities, which by degrees grew independent.</p>

<p class='c001'>This distribution of power into many hands had the effect of destroying
all systematic plans of government. Princes were obliged
to act according to the perpetual fluctuation of circumstances,
until by a revolution in their favour, the power of the vassals was
swallowed up, and confined within the limits of a more regular
authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>In proportion as this revolution took place among the nations
of Europe, the system of their government resumed a more permanent
form. Justice was administred with more uniformity;
and from this arose a body of laws, which, in some countries,
were called customs: in others, as in England, common law. Wars
then became less frequent; and the military services not being necessary
on all occasions, insensibly became converted into taxes,
proportioned to the exigencies of the time.</p>

<p class='c001'>During this period, the coin and precious metals of Europe were
lodged, in a great measure, in private coffers. If wars brought
them forth for a short time, they soon found their way back again.
Princes were generally extravagant, and spent money as fast as they
got it. In proportion as industry and alienation increased, the coin
came abroad; the inhabitants became easy in their circumstances;
the state flourished, and acquired reputation. The riches and
power of a state began then to be estimated, as they ought to be,
not by their treasures locked up, but by what was found in circulation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>that is, by their industry. Venice, Genoa, and the Hans-towns,
set the example. The Jews, banished from France, on account
of their extortions in the time of the holy wars, fled, as it
is said, into Lombardy, and there invented the use of bills of exchange,
for drawing their riches from countries to which they
durst not resort to bring them off. Interest for money began to be
considered as lawful in many cases: merchants were protected by
Princes, for the sake of the consequences of trade and industry:
and from such small beginnings has that mighty engine of public
credit sprung.</p>

<p class='c001'>While Princes mortgaged their lands and principalities, in order
to obtain a sum of money, they acted upon the principles of private
credit. This was the case in the more early times, before government
acquired that liability which is necessary to establish a
firm confidence. In proportion as it drew towards a regular
system, the dawn of credit put on appearances analogous to the
solidity of the fund upon which it was established.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second step was to raise money upon a branch of taxes assigned
to the lender, for the reimbursement of his capital and interest.
We shall shew the consequences of this plan of credit
from some examples, which will fully point out all its inconveniencies.</p>

<p class='c001'>This plan of administration was attended with so much abuse,
and so much oppression, that statesmen began to despair of carrying
on public affairs by such expedients; and therefore concluded
that the only way to obtain money at the least expence, was to raise
it on the subject within the year, or upon what they called short
funds.</p>

<p class='c001'>At length public credit assumed its present form. Money was borrowed
upon determinate or perpetual annuities: a fund was provided
for that purpose: and the refunding of the capital was, in
many cases, left in the option of government, but was never to be
demandable by the creditor.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>This is a short view of the progress of public credit. The principles
upon which it is built are so few, that were I to confine myself
to a bare deduction of them, little new or interesting could
be said. I shall therefore steer another course: I shall collect the
sentiments of some eminent politicians, who have either writ upon,
or acted in the administration of this branch of government; and
by applying principles as we go along, I shall be enabled to point
out the extraneous circumstances which are so apt to involve this
subject in obscurity. Had we not before our eyes the numberless
examples of this kind, it would hardly be possible to conceive how
so great a confusion, and so many calamities, could have followed
upon the operations of public credit.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.4.3' class='c015'>CHAP. III. <br /> <i>Of Anticipations, or borrowing Money upon Assignments to Taxes for the Discharge of Principal and Interest.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>I have already observed, that by the cessation of the constant
wars, in which all Europe was engaged during the feudal government
of the barons, nations began to enjoy some sort of tranquillity.
Upon this the military services became insensibly converted
into taxes; and as Princes extended their jurisdictions over
the cities, which had been formerly more under the protection of
the bishops who resided in them, taxes were augmented. These
impositions were very inconsiderable, with respect to what they
brought into the King’s coffers. The policy in raising them was
bad; the frauds in collecting them were great.</p>

<p class='c001'>These considerations engaged Princes to begin by contracting debts,
and to pay afterwards by temporary assignments to the taxes imposed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>From this again ensued the most terrible extortions on the side
of the tax-gatherers, so often complained of by those who have
writ on the affairs of France, as we shall see in the following
chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Philip <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>le bel</i></span>, King of France, was the first who, in 1301, admitted,
with great policy, the inhabitants of cities to have a seat in
the states of the kingdom. He formed them into a distinct body,
and called them <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tiers etat</i></span>, or the third estate, after the clergy and
the nobility. His view was to facilitate thereby the jurisdiction
he wanted to establish over those cities, and to engage them to
consent to the imposition of taxes for carrying on his wars in Flanders,
and for opposing the ambitious views of Boniface VIII. Accordingly,
the people began to pay willingly, when once they found
that they had a vote in what concerned them.</p>

<p class='c001'>I take it for granted, that every tax, about that time, was imposed
for a particular purpose, and assigned either to creditors, or
to people who advanced money upon it: because we are told that
the first imposition granted by the states to a King of France as a
permanent branch of revenue, was an excise upon spirituous liquors
granted to Philip de Valois, in the year 1345; at which time, however,
according to Mr. d’Eon’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Memoires pour servir à l’Histoire generale
des Finances</cite></span>, there were not less than twenty two different taxes
known in France, which he enumerates as follows:</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Tailles</i>, <i>complaintes</i>, <i>charges</i>, <i>redevances</i>, <i>coutumes</i>, <i>peages</i>, <i>travers</i>, <i>passages</i>,
<i>centiemes</i>, <i>cinquantiemes</i>, <i>ôtes</i>, <i>chevaucheês</i>, <i>subventions</i>, <i>exactions</i>,
<i>chevaleries</i>, <i>aides</i>, <i>mariages</i>, <i>toultes</i>, <i>impositions</i>, <i>prisons</i>, <i>servitudes</i>,</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nouvellettes</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>That all these impositions must have been mere trifles, I gather
from a circumstance in the Political History of France, mentioned
by the author just cited, which being itself exceedingly curious
and tending greatly to confirm many things which I have advanced
concerning the small circulation in former times, I shall here briefly
mention it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>In 1356, John, King of France, applied to the States for 50,000
livres, about 9165<i>l.</i> sterling, to pay his army. The States, besides
several other taxes imposed to pay this sum, granted him 8 deniers
on the livre, or 3⅓ <i>per cent.</i> upon all meat, drink, and merchandize,
sold in France within the year; that is to say, upon the whole
alienations of France. The tax was levied, but fell so far short of
the sum required, that it was made up by a poll-tax.</p>

<p class='c001'>Can any example be better calculated for forming a notion of the
circulation of France at that time?</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be here alleged that the prices of every thing were then
so very low, that no judgment can be formed concerning the <em>quantity</em>
of alienation from the smallness of the sum. This objection is
of no force, as I shall presently shew.</p>

<p class='c001'>We know from the records of the selling price of grain in France,
which was then remarkably cheap in proportion to the years which
followed and which had preceeded, that in 1356, the septier of
wheat, or 4 Winchester bushels, sold for 17 sols 8 deniers of the
then currency, which was 12 livres to the marc fine silver, and a
French soldier’s allowance for bread, to this day, is 3 septiers, or
12 Winchester bushels a year. Now let me suppose, that the whole
50,000 livres had been raised by this imposition of 3⅓ <i>per cent.</i> or <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub>
of the total value of the single article of corn sold at market, which
was far from being the case, and then compare that with the number
of men who could have been subsisted with all the corn sold in
France at that time.</p>

<p class='c001'>If <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub> of the price was the tax, then by multiplying 50,000 livres
by 30, we have the value of the corn sold; to wit, 1 500 000 livres:
divide this sum by the value of what a man consumes in a year, to
wit, 3 septiers at 17 sols 8 deniers, which make 2 livres 13 sols,
and the quotient will be the number of portions for a man, to wit,
566 037. So the whole alienation of France, at that time, fell far
below the value of as much wheat as would have fed 566 037 men.</p>

<p class='c001'>What a poor idea does this communicate of the state of Europe only
400 years ago! It would be in vain to seek for examples to illustrate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>any principle of our complicated modern oeconomy in the histories
of those times: their taxes, their credit, and their debts, resembled
ours in nothing but the name.</p>

<p class='c001'>I now come nearer home, and give an account of the ideas of
public credit formed by Davenant, who flourished about the time
of the revolution in 1688, which I may take to be the æra of public
credit in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>No person at that time, whose writings I have seen, appears to
have so thoroughly understood those matters as Davenant. He
was a man of theory, as well as knowledge of facts: he had an
opportunity which few people have, to be well instructed in the
one and the other; and he turned his talents to the best advantage
for promoting the interest of his country. He has writ many tracts
on political subjects, which, when carefully read and compared
with what experience has since taught us, cast great light upon
many questions relative to the subject of this inquiry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Davenant, like other great men of his time, was of opinion that
borrowing money upon what he calls short funds, was much preferable
to that upon perpetual interest; and he thought the most
adviseable plan of all, could it be accomplished, was to raise the
money wanted within the year.</p>

<p class='c001'>Men, at that time, had a terror upon them in contracting debts for
the public: they considered the nation as they would a private man,
whose interest is one, uncompounded, and relative to himself alone:
in this light, creditors appeared as formidable as enemies; they
were looked upon by ministers as such; and this general opinion
on one side, contributed, no doubt, to make the monied people less
interested in the distress of government, and more ready to lay hold
of every opportunity of improving such occasions, for their own
advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Government was in constant war with creditors: when ready
money failed in England, it had nothing to pay with but exchequer
tallies, upon the taxes imposed; these were much more easily issued
than acquitted. When the first year’s amount of a tax was engaged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>people considered the security of what was to follow as very precarious;
consequently, the value of it diminished.</p>

<p class='c001'>This method, however, succeeded far better in paying off debts
already contracted, than in contracting new ones; and the hardships
put upon those who had advanced money to government,
and who were paid by assignments upon taxes previously engaged,
made people afterwards very diffident, except upon proper security.
The limited form of the English government, prevented the violent
proceedings between ministers and public creditors, which were
common in France; and this circumstance contributed, no doubt,
to establish the credit of the former upon the better footing. But
still the long expectation of payment of the capital and interest,
upon a distant fund, made Davenant acknowledge that 700,000<i>l.</i> in
ready money, would at any time go farther than a million in tallies;
and yet he thought it was better for the state to borrow the
million upon a plan of discharging the debt in three or four years,
than to obtain the 700,000<i>l.</i> at the expence of a perpetual interest
of 8 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>There were many more considerations which moved Davenant to
prefer what he calls short funds to perpetual interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the general opinion in his time (not his own indeed, for
he endeavoured to shew the fallacy of it) that money borrowed upon
the anticipation of a fund, <em>raised and appropriated for the discharge of
it</em>, was not a debt upon the state; because it did not diminish the
former revenue. We have a remarkable instance of the prevalence
of this opinion, in the famous memorial presented by M. Desmaretz
to Philip Duke of Orleans, after the death of the late King of
France; wherein he advances, that during seven campaigns, from
1708 to the peace of Rastad, while he had been at the head of the
King’s finances, he had not increased the public debts by more than
nine millions of livres capital: and yet when he came into the administration,
in 1708, the King’s debts did not amount to 700 millions;
and we have seen, that at the time of his death, they were
upwards of 2000 millions. But Desmaretz did not reckon the difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>of about 1300 millions; because he had settled them upon
funds of his own creation. This was so much the language of the
times, that no criticism was made upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is remarkable, that Davenant, in giving an account of the
debts of England, during the period of which he writes, that is,
from the revolution down to the peace of Ryswick, hardly ever
takes notice of the sums paid for interest upon them. The minds
of men at that time were totally taken up with the payment of capitals;
and providing these could be discharged in a few years, it
was no matter, they thought, what they cost in the mean time.</p>

<p class='c001'>As long as nations at war observe the same policy in their methods
of raising money, the ways in which they proceed are of the less
importance: but when any one state makes an alteration, by which
more money is thrown into their hands than they could formerly
obtain; this circumstance obliges every other state to adopt the same
method. Thus while Princes made war with the amount of their
treasures and annual income, the balance of their power depended
on the balance of such resources: when they anticipated their income
on both sides, for a few years, the balance was in proportion
still: when, afterwards, they adopted long funds and perpetual
interest, the supplies increased; but still the balance was
determined as formerly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The usefulness, therefore, of an inquiry into the principles of
public credit, has not so much for its object to discover the interest
of states in adopting one mode of credit preferably to another, as to
discover the consequences of every one; and to point out the methods
of making them severally turn out to the best account for the
state, considered as a body politic by itself, and for the individuals
which compose it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When so many different relations are taken in, the subject becomes
much more complex, and therefore the consequences <em>which
can only be guessed at</em> must be less determinate: but on the other hand,
it opens the mind, and suggests many hints which with time may
be improved for the good of society.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>People who barely relate political facts, only afford an exercise
to the memory: those who deduce principles, and trace a chain
of reasoning from them, give exercise to the understanding; and
as a small spark may raise a mighty flame, so a hint thrown out by
a slender genius may set all the great men of a nation on a plan of
general reformation and improvement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now take a view of the state of public credit in England,
at the peace of Ryswick; in order to shew how Davenant came to
be so great an enemy to long funds, and more especially to perpetual
interest. We shall at the same time point out from what causes
the great change of sentiments at present proceeds.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the peace of Ryswick, the debts of England, according to
Davenant, in his fifth discourse upon the public revenues and trade
of England, stood at 17 552 544<i>l.</i> sterling; call it 17 millions and a
half, as we have no occasion to calculate with exactness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this debt the capital of 3½ millions was sunk, as he calls it;
because 1 300 000<i>l.</i> was on lives at 14 <i>per cent.</i> and what was over
to make up the 3½ millions, was intended to remain a perpetual
burthen on the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>For paying the interest of this sum, no less than 400 000<i>l.</i> a year
was necessary, which makes on the whole above 11 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>But then it must be observed, that more than one third of the
sum was upon lives at 14 <i>per cent.</i>: the debt due to the bank, of
which we have spoken in another place, was 1 200 000<i>l.</i> for which
was paid 100 000<i>l.</i> a year, including 4000<i>l.</i> allowed for the charge
of management: the remaining million was upon lottery tickets,
bearing about 8 <i>per cent.</i> the price at which the bank had lent.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second branch of debts was near 11 millions, which, he says,
were in course of payment; because they were secured upon
branches of revenue engaged for discharging them. A part of this
class of debts was to be extinguished in the year 1700: and whenever
that was done, then a proportion of the appropriated taxes,
amounting yearly to above a million sterling, was immediately to
be taken off.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>The third class of debts were those not provided for at all; which
in the place referred to, he makes to amount to no more than
3 200 000<i>l.</i> but he afterwards finds his mistake, and that they in
fact amounted to above 5 millions and a half, which makes the
debts of England at the peace of Ryswick, to have been near 20
millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Was it then any wonder, that a man who wished well to his
country, should prefer borrowing upon short funds at any expence
whatever in the mean time, rather than at perpetual interest, when
he found that parliaments could not be prevailed upon to allow any
tax to subsist one instant after the discharge of the debts for the
payment of which it had been appropriated?</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, there was very little to be gained by borrowing upon
long funds and perpetual interest, as long as the lenders considered
their advantage to consist principally in getting their capitals refunded.</p>

<p class='c001'>The plain matter of fact was, that trade at that time was only
beginning to take root in England, and demanded funds to carry it
on. The use of banks had not then been discovered, for turning property
into money. Circulation, consequently, was confined to the
coin; and profits on trade were very great. All these circumstances
rendred capitals of essential use; and the consequence was, to raise
interest to an excessive height.</p>

<p class='c001'>Compare this situation with the present. Were the capital of 140
millions sterling thrown by Great Britain, in a few years, into the
hands of the present creditors; were France, on the other hand,
to throw in as much, what trade could absorb it? Capitals now are
only of value in proportion to the interest they bring; and so long
as the interest paid on public debts is sufficient to keep circulation
full, and no more, interest will stand as it is: when that ceases to
be the case, as in time of war, we see interest begins to rise; and
when, on the other hand, the interest paid, proves more than sufficient
for the uses of circulation, as upon a return of peace, then,
from the same principles, interest must diminish.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Davenant, like an able politician, who had the state of facts before
him, reasoned according to actual circumstances. Whatever
was borrowed on long funds, was charged on the standing revenue
of the state, which parliament was very unwilling to increase in
proportion to the charges laid upon it. This, of itself, was argument
sufficient with him to cast his view upon short appropriations,
or upon his favourite object, of raising money within the year, to
supply the exigencies of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in this operation he found great difficulties. In his treatise
of ways and means, article <em>excises</em>, where he is searching for expedients
to provide money for the war, he plainly shews a thorough
knowledge of that imposition. It had taken place in England as
far back as the great civil war, and formed at the revolution about
⅓ of all the revenue: but what is very extraordinary, and which at
present will hardly be credited, the excise had at that time the effect
of sinking the price of the subject excised, instead of raising the
price of what was produced from it. Thus the excise upon malt,
after the revolution, had the effect of lowering the price of barley,
instead of raising the price of beer.</p>

<p class='c001'>This effect of excises Davenant saw; from which he, and since
him many more have concluded, that all excises fall ultimately
upon the land.</p>

<p class='c001'>This circumstance, together with a feeling for the interest of the
great number of <em>idle</em> poor at that time, who must constantly suffer
by excises, engaged Davenant to propose having recourse to the
land-property and poll-taxes, for raising, within the year, the sums
required for carrying on the war.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to his proposal, there was to be no less than 3 millions
raised by a land tax, besides half a million by a quarterly poll, which
was, at that time, above 100,000<i>l.</i> more than all the permanent
taxes of England put together.</p>

<p class='c001'>A proposal of this kind coming from Davenant, shews the difference
of situation between those times and the present. On this subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>more is to be learned by comparing facts, than by all the reasoning
in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how credit stood in England during the reign of
William III. It was then in its infancy, and was set upon the principles
of a free and limited authority, exercised by ministers of
state at all times responsible to parliament at the risk of their heads,
in case of any open violation of the public faith. This is the best
of all securities against the bad exercise of power.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whoever reads the admirable writings of Davenant, and compares
his ideas with what experience has since taught us, concerning
the nature of taxes and public credit, will plainly discover that
the great distress of England at that time, proceeded from the following
causes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The enterprize they were engaged in, was far beyond their
power to support, although they had the greatest part of Europe to
assist them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bravery of the British nation was ill supported with money,
the sinews of war.</p>

<p class='c001'>The coin soon after the revolution fell into the greatest disorder,
which sent it away; and no expedient was found to supply its
place for the uses of domestic circulation; and, consequently, the
fixed revenue could not be paid, nor industry carried on.</p>

<p class='c001'>The people were unaccustomed to taxes: tunnage and poundage,
the branch with which they were best acquainted, and which they
bore with the least murmuring, because it was little felt by individuals,
together with the excise upon beer and ale, the hearth
money, the post-house, and wine-licences, composed the whole of
the permanent revenue of the state, and amounted to about one
million and a half sterling: besides which, the parliament had
granted new customs (all to cease before 1690) to the amount of
about half a million more, upon wines, tobacco, sugar, and French
linnen. This was the state of the revenue at the revolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>One would imagine that England, under so small a burthen,
might have been able to make the greatest efforts.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Were we now to grapple with France, under such circumstances,
what sanguine hopes would we not form of success! The case turned
out widely different: the first benefit the nation expected in consequence
of their liberty restored, was an abolition of the hearth money;
a tax which raised over the whole kingdom, 245,000<i>l.</i> and
was considered as an insupportable burthen.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such sentiments and dispositions in the English nation, might
have been a sufficient indication of what was to be expected from
the war; the consequences of which had, before 1695, produced the
following changes in the revenue.</p>

<p class='c001'>The tunnage and poundage, which at the revolution produced
600,000<i>l.</i> was by this time reduced to 286,687<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The excise upon beer and ale, from 666,383<i>l.</i> was reduced to
391,275<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The hearth money was abolished.</p>

<p class='c001'>The post-house, from 65,000<i>l.</i> was reduced to 63,517<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The wine-licences, from 10,000<i>l.</i> to 5000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The temporary customs which subsisted at the revolution, were
now expired, and had been either continued by new grants, or by
others of the same nature introduced in their stead. The former
had produced 415,472<i>l.</i> the new produced 373,839<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The last and most important grant of all, was an additional excise
upon beer and ale, which produced 450,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The revenue at the revolution produced, clear of all charges,
2 001 855<i>l.</i> sterling. A revenue established at pretty much the same
rate, and nearly on the same objects, with an addition of a new
excise, which produced 450,000<i>l.</i> produced net in 1694, no more
than 1 570 318<i>l.</i> so that, deducting the new excise, the old revenue
was diminished in its produce, no less than 1 081 527<i>l.</i> or above
one half, in five years time.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a country like England, at that time, taxes were of little use
to the state, and were an excessive burthen on the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>What could they be paid out of? Not out of the value in the
hands of the people; because there was no way provided for turning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>that value into money. The whole of the money coined before
the end of the war in 1697, did not amount to 8½ millions. It
was not to be expected that during the war, foreign coin was to
come in, except in consequence of borrowing; and we may be very
certain, that all that was borrowed, and a great part of what had
been coined at home, had gone out from the year 1695 to 1697.
Under these circumstances, the exchequer issued tallies of wood, a
notable expedient for facilitating circulation! And the bank of
England lent not one farthing upon mortgage: all that was possible
to be raised on the land and on the people, by pound-rate, assessment,
and poll-tax, was imposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now let us recall our principles concerning circulation, alienation,
and banking upon mortgage, and combine these with what we
have so frequently repeated, and I think demonstrated, viz. that in
proportion to the extent of alienation, and the demands for money,
a circulating equivalent should be provided, so as to be ready at
the hand of every person who has property to pledge for it; and
then decide whether it was any wonder that credit in England
should have been at so low an ebb at the peace of Ryswick; that
taxes should have diminished in their produce; that interest should
have risen to such an extravagant height; that the people should
have groaned under a load from which they could not relieve themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under such circumstances, England appears to me in the light of
a dumb man put to the torture in order to extort a confession.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were eight or nine millions sterling in coin, and a few wooden
sticks, the tallies, constantly sold at a great discount, a circulating
value sufficient to supply the exigencies of a state which was spending
annually at the rate of five or six millions?</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence of this total drain of money, was, that people
could neither consume exciseable commodities, or pay the taxes laid
upon their persons and solid property.</p>

<p class='c001'>The excises failed, because the body of the people, who paid
them, were interrupted in their industry, for want of money to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>carry on alienation. Those who were liable to the arbitrary impositions,
such as the landlords, could not pay; because what they
had, their land, could not be given in payment.</p>

<p class='c001'>From what I have here laid together, we may determine, that as
alienations among individuals cannot exceed the proportion of the
circulating equivalent of a country, so a statesman when he intends
<em>suddenly</em> to augment the taxes of his people, without interrupting
their industry, which then becomes still more necessary than ever,
should augment the circulating equivalent in proportion to the additional
demand for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, according to my notions, cannot be so well compassed as,
1. by establishing banks of circulation upon mortgage: 2. by relieving
those companies of the load of paying foreign balances by
giving bills at par, or at a small exchange: and 3. by providing
funds abroad for the payment of them, according to the principles
above deduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such expedients will work their effect, in a nation where the
public faith stands upon the solid security of an honest parliament,
and upon that responsibility which is fixed upon those who are
trusted with the exertions of the royal authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>I think I may illustrate this operation by a simile.</p>

<p class='c001'>A gentleman chooses to form a cascade of the water which serves
to turn his corn-mill; consequently, the mill stops: but in its stead,
he immediately erects another which turns with the wind. Coin
is the water, bank paper is the wind, and both are equally well
calculated for the use they are put to.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.4.4' class='c015'>CHAP. IV. <br /> <i>Of the State of public Credit in France before the reign of Louis XIV. and of the Sentiment of the great Richlieu upon that Subject.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Having laid before my reader the sentiments of Davenant on
the subject of public credit, which were analogous to the
then state of England, it may be instructive to compare them with
those of another very great man, in a rival nation; I mean the Cardinal
de Richlieu.</p>

<p class='c001'>The constitution of Great Britain at present, is pretty much what
it was in Davenant’s time: and that of France does not differ widely
from what it was at the death of Louis XIII.</p>

<p class='c001'>Britain and France are two nations, rivals in every thing worthy
of emulation, and similar in those distresses which are the inseparable
concomitants of modern ambition, debts and taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>As long as the constitution of the two governments shall stand as
at present, Britain will constantly have the advantage in borrowing:
France will have it in paying off her debts. It is this contrast
which engages me to enter into the following detail. I consider it not
only as a piece of historical curiosity, but as a subject of profound
reflection, from which much instruction may be gathered.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fate of kingly power was decided, both in Britain and in
France, much about the same time. In France, it was supported
by Cardinal de Richlieu; in Britain, it was broken to pieces under
Charles I.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before that time there was no fixed form of government established
in either country; nor can ever a regular constitution take
place any where, until the mechanism of a state becomes so complex
as to render changes extremely difficult. This is becoming
the case more and more every day; and upon this and nothing else
will depend the stability of our present forms.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>Let us now take a view of the sentiments of a great minister,
delivered in writing by himself, in his political testament; the
authority of which would never have been called in question, had
the matter it contains been properly attended to, and well understood.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in the 7th paragraph of the 9th chapter of the testament,
where the Cardinal shews his ability in paying off the debts of
France: and in going through the subject, he casually has thrown
out several things, which enable us to form a judgment of the
state of taxes, and of the effects they were found to produce in his
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is pedantry,” says he, “to maintain that a prince has no
right to draw money from his subjects, and that he ought to content
himself with the possession of their hearts. None, however,
but flatterers, the pest of society, can maintain, that he may
draw from them, justly, whatever he thinks fit; and that his
right extends, in this particular, as far as his will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The taxes of France at this time had been augmented far beyond
<a id='corr368.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='their'>heir</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_368.19'><ins class='correction' title='their'>heir</ins></a></span> due proportion; and this had produced many strange and
contradictory phænomena; which, as we shall now see, misled the
Cardinal in many respects; because his experience was not sufficient
to discover the causes of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The augmentation of impositions on the people,” says he,
“does the King <em>so much</em> hurt by raising prices, as to compensate all
he can gain.” If we suppose that the King gained by the augmentation;
that is to say, that the tax, when increased, really produced
more than before, and raised prices proportionally; then the
King could only lose his proportional part, but never the whole.
If the tax, by being augmented, produced less than before, which
was the case often, then he lost by a diminution upon his income,
not by the rise of prices. But this was not the case; because deficiencies
of that kind could not fall upon the King, but upon his
farmers.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>The true reason was, that the King paid most of his expences
by assignments upon the taxes; and then, no doubt, the higher
they were raised, and the more difficult to recover, the dearer
every undertaking would cost the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>This reasoning upon the effect of taxes shews, that at that time
the doctrine of them was not well understood. No wonder: theory
is not sufficient to lay open political consequences, even to the
greatest genius. All our information as to these matters arises
from experience, and all our instruction from our attention and
reflection.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a proof of this, he mentions, almost in the same place, an
effect of the increase of taxes, which is quite contrary to the
former.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Consumption,” says he, “diminishes, as taxes augment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a contingent, but not a necessary consequence, as we
have seen, and has the effect of lowering prices.</p>

<p class='c001'>I mention these particulars, only to shew how little this great
man had studied the principles of taxation, or combined the causes
of those phænomena which he saw arising from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such contrary effects could not fail to be felt, when taxes were
<a id='corr369.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mixed'>raised</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_369.21'><ins class='correction' title='mixed'>raised</ins></a></span> in the manner usual at that time, and when no method was
contrived for augmenting the currency.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Richlieu’s time the custom was to treat with the <em>partisans</em>, as
they were called, or undertakers for the farm of taxes; and for a
sum of money, valued at a certain interest, to give them a right to
levy certain impositions on the people, esteemed equivalent to the
rate agreed upon; some in one province, some in another, as the
parties could agree. Then the partisans fell to work with the
people, and committed the most horrid extortions. In the 4th §.
of his 4th chapter, he says, “The abuse is carried such a length,
as to be quite insupportable, and must end in the ruin of the
state; the people are plundered, not taxed; fortunes are made by
rapine, not industry: using the partisans like spunges is very
just; but liable, on the other hand, to great abuse, when not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>conducted with moderation and justice.” This is a very different
system of taxation from that carried on in England in Davenant’s
time, and must have produced effects very dissimilar.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it may be asked, if these partisans in France had found
out means of raising money, far beyond the King’s intention;
what prevented the Cardinal from examining into such means, and
using them in a gentle and equitable manner, to the extent only of
satisfying the creditors for the money borrowed from them?</p>

<p class='c001'>In those days several difficulties occurred, which rendered this
expedient impracticable.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The partisans would lend in no other way; they would
have nothing to do with the King as a debtor: his credit was not
well established; and by having the direct administration of a tax,
they considered themselves as more secure.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, Had the King levied the money on the people, and been
paymaster to the creditors himself, there would have been no gains
to the partisans but what were stipulated: had they exacted more
than legal interest, they exposed themselves to great danger; and
consequently would not lend. So, by delivering up the people to
be plundered, the King made a better bargain, he thought, than
any other way; and if the partisans plundered the people, the
Cardinal plundered them in his turn.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, At this time there were not, as now, merchants of extensive
credit, and fair character, who serve as interposed persons for the
whole money’d interest in Europe, and who can fill a subscription
for millions with a single name.</p>

<p class='c001'>The partisans themselves, as the Cardinal observes, had often
neither money or credit at setting out: but by parcelling their undertaking
into many hands, they got together what was necessary.
Thus the subaltern associates were in a moment, like locusts, spread
over the whole face of the country, and plundering went on in
every quarter.</p>

<p class='c001'>This represents a quite different system of credit from what we
see established, even in France, at present; where the tax-gatherers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>are still loudly complained of, though much more than they deserve.
The mode of raising the taxes is now most exactly specified
by the King; and nothing more can be exacted than according
to the plan laid down; but in every case severe penalties are
imposed upon frauds, and when levied, are accounted for to the
farmers; but when compounded for under-hand, sink into private
men’s pockets.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a country where taxes are rightly established, industrious
people have no occasion to indemnify themselves by fraud for the
taxes they pay; they have a more certain method of being refunded.
This shall be explained in its proper place.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this method of oppression in the Cardinal’s time, a great part
of the odium was removed from the King, and cast upon the
partisans. The people resembled a dog who bites the stick with
which he has been struck, instead of biting him who holds it<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c017'><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. Thus were taxes established in France, in spight of the great aversion of that nation
to them. The exigencies of the state were apparent; Princes were considered as
under an absolute necessity to find money at any rate; they appeared to be in the
hands of unrelenting usurers, who became the execration of the people, to whose
fury they were sometimes delivered over, when stripped of their wealth: the people
were now and then relieved of a part of their burthen; the tax remained under milder
management; formed an addition to the King’s revenue, and served as a fund for future
emergencies.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the nature of man is such, that the more he grows in wealth, the more the desire
of spending it increases. Thus the fund provided for unforeseen emergencies, is
insensibly incorporated with that which is appropriated for the current service of the
state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing however is more certain than that in time of war, far greater sums are
required than any people can pay, without contracting debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not then indispensibly necessary, either, 1<i>mo</i>, To have a sum locked up in
treasure? Or, 2<i>do</i>, A fund appropriated, to borrow upon in time of war, which may
serve to pay off the debts in time of peace? Or, 3<i>tio</i>, To borrow upon the stipulation
of an annual payment, which may, in a certain number of years, acquit both
interest and principal?
The first is the plan of the King of Prussia; the second that of England; the third
is, in a good measure, that of France: Holland borrows no more, and pays as she
can what she owes; Spain lives on her income; and Austria remained in the old way
till very lately, without credit, and consequently without much debt.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>I have now said enough to point out the method of borrowing
money in France at this time, from which the nature of the security
may easily be gathered.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Cardinal, upon the supposition of an approaching peace,
enters into the plan of paying off what had been contracted. He
was resolved to preserve credit; for even at that time, the consequence
of that great engine was sufficiently felt by this great man,
to relieve the people, and to get rid of the debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>After a long detail of all the branches of the revenue, and after
shewing how they might be improved, he draws out a general state
of them, and of the debts affecting them; and then adds, “The
total revenue of the kingdom amounts to near 80 millions;”
(the silver was then at 27 livres 10 sols the marc fine, which, valued
at 2<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> sterling, makes the 80 millions worth above 6 millions
sterling) “of which there is above 45 millions engaged for
the debts. By good management I pretend that this immense
load of debts, which seems to be the ruin of the King, shall
turn out to his ease and opulence. Some imagine it would be a
right measure to free the state entirely of her burthen, (a general
spunge) but as she cannot, certainly, support all the burthen,
so neither does reason dictate that she should be entirely
set free.” No modern statesman could form a better judgment
of things. The Cardinal’s ideas are just and profound; and it is
astonishing how a man uninstructed by our experience should see
so far into remote consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>He next lays down different schemes for paying the debts, upon
the return of peace and tranquillity. They are all arbitrary, more
or less, according to the standard of English ideas of credit. But
if we abstract from one expedient lately discovered, to wit, the diminishing
the interest, and allowing the capitals to remain, I doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>if any modern statesman could discover any other than those
which the Cardinal has proposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>A preliminary step to all his schemes was, <em>by an act of power</em>,
to reduce the debts which bore a higher interest, to that of the
16 penny, or to a little more than 6 <i>per cent.</i> This method of
reduction has constantly been and is still practised in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he proposes to enter into an account with the creditors for
the sums they had received; and to consider whatever they had obtained
above the legal interest, as payments in part of the capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>This scheme however he rejects, upon examination. He says it
is agreeable to equity; but that it would have the effect of totally
destroying all credit for the future.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second expedient was, to reimburse the creditors the sums
which they really paid for the annuities assigned to them: but that
he found impossible to verify; because they had had the address to
specify, in their contracts, sums far exceeding what they really
paid. For this reason he rejects the second expedient also; and
adopts a third, as the best plan of any for paying off the debts.
This was, to value the capitals at what they then sold for in the
market, before the peace was concluded.</p>

<p class='c001'>This method appeared to the Cardinal the most equitable, at
least he says so, and the only one practicable; but in my opinion
it was the most arbitrary of the three; the most liable to abuse,
and the most opposite to the principles of public credit, as at present
established: and yet it is a thought, which, when conducted
with justice, may upon some occasions answer excellent purposes,
as I shall observe in a proper place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had he adopted the first expedient, of ascertaining the value of
the real advance, there was an appearance of justice; because the
creditors were thereby represented as usurers; and by repaying
them what they had advanced, by the enjoyment of an income
above the legal interest, he treated them with more indulgence
than the laws allow between private persons: but when money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>was borrowed in time of war, a higher interest should have been
allowed for it than in time of peace, when it was to be paid off;
and therefore to take the standard of peace, in reckoning with
the creditors who had lent in time of war, was an evident injustice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could he, according to the second scheme, have discovered exactly
the sums which had been paid for the annuities given, and
offered reimbursements upon that footing, less could have been
said against it; because the mentioning more in the contract than
what had been paid, was a palpable fraud against the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third method, which the Cardinal approves of, contains
this piece of great injustice, that the antient creditors of the state
who had paid 12 years purchase for their contracts, that is, those
who had lent at about 8 <i>per cent.</i> might by this scheme be paid off
with one half of what they originally paid. If it be answered,
that nothing is worth more than what it can bring; I answer, that
it may be worth more than what it can bring <em>at a particular time</em>.
During a war, an annuity which had been bought at 12 years purchase
in time of peace, will fall to five, providing annuities can
then be bought at that rate. The new loans constantly regulate
the value of the old capitals; but upon a return of peace, they
will rise to the original value.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another injustice here was, that a minister, by borrowing a sum
at a very high interest, at a time he wanted to set a value on the
capitals, might sink this value. And, in the third place, the
greatest injustice of all consisted in this, that the Cardinal had no
thoughts of any reimbursement, as we shall see by what follows.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was, at this time, one class of annuities constituted at
8 <i>per cent.</i> These he proposed to reduce to 6 <i>per cent.</i> as above, by
his preliminary operation. Such annuities sold at that time for
five years purchase. These, says the Cardinal, <em>we must fix at that
value</em>; and by allowing the proprietors to enjoy them for 7½ years,
the capital and interest will be paid off.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>Other annuities constituted upon the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span> sold for six years purchase,
which, by the same rule, were to be paid off in 8½ years.</p>

<p class='c001'>The annuities and other debts charged at this time upon the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span> alone, amounted to 26 millions a year; and by this scheme,
the whole was to be paid off in 8½ years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides these, there were engagements upon other branches
of the revenue, which sold at different prices. All were to be set
upon a proportional footing. The annuities which sold the dearest,
were at 7½ years purchase, which were to be paid in 11½ years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, by the Cardinal’s scheme, the debts of France, which at
this time bore an interest of about 45 millions, were entirely to be
paid off, in about 12 years, without any new imposition; and
when that was concluded, the lands were to be discharged of 26
millions of yearly <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>, near two millions sterling, and the King
was to have a clear revenue of 53 millions, or about 4 millions of
our money, which with the 26 millions taken off the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>, make
79 millions; the total amount of the French revenue at that time.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now point out the characteristic differences between the
principles upon which the credit of England and France were established,
at the two periods of which we have been speaking.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had two such writers as Davenant and Richlieu been to be met
with in the same age, and at a time when England and France
were engaged in contracting debts, the contrast would have been
stronger; but as it is, it suits our purpose. The debts contracted in
France from 1708, when credit fell, to the end of the war in
1714, were in consequence of rapine and extortion, as in Richlieu’s
time: and the operations upon them, after the peace of
Utrecht, resemble those of Richlieu in some very material circumstances.
Such as, 1<i>mo</i>, That all the debts were then, by an act of
power, put at 4 <i>per cent.</i> without any regard to the original stipulations.
2<i>do</i>, That what the Cardinal despaired of accomplishing,
the Regent undertook, and executed, at a great expence to the
King, and with great injustice to many individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>He established a commission, called the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>visa</i></span>, to inquire into the
unfunded debts, which amounted to 600 millions. His intention
was, to discover the effective sums which had been paid for the
grounds of debt. The most favourable classes of these debts consisted
in arrears of pay to the army, indemnities for pillage, and
the like, constituted by notes issued from the office called the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>extraordinaires des guerres</i></span>, which were diminished ⅕; the second
class was diminished ⅖; the third class ⅗; and the last of all,
sums due to brokers, usurers, &amp;c. were diminished ⅘.</p>

<p class='c001'>But alas! there was not the least shadow of justice in this operation;
because long before the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>visa</i></span> was established, most of the
grounds of those debts had circulated from hand to hand, under
the greatest discredit: so that the real sufferers were then beyond
the reach of the indemnity offered; and the usurers and brokers
who had bought them up, were those who made fortunes by them.
The Cardinal’s plan of paying at the selling price, would have
proved, <em>in this particular case</em>, more rational, and more according to
equity, than any other: so greatly do circumstances influence our
decisions in all political matters!</p>

<p class='c001'>By the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>visa</i></span>, the 600 millions were reduced to 250 millions, and
put at 4 <i>per cent.</i> like all the other debts. No plan was proposed at
first for paying off the capitals; but a sum was appropriated, though
very ill paid, for discharging the interest. We have discussed sufficiently
the famous operations of the Missisippi; by which an attempt
was made to throw the whole national debt on the company
of the Indies; and we have seen how it succeeded.</p>

<p class='c001'>The distance, therefore, of Richlieu’s time, from Davenant’s,
occasions very little deception in comparing the principles of
French and English credit: and when we come to examine the present
state of that question, I am afraid we shall find, in France,
enough of the old system still remaining, to verify my observation,
that the French have the advantage in paying their debts; the
English, in contracting them. Where the balance of advantage
may lie, will be the subject of more speculation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>The first essential difference I find between the credit of France
and that of England, in the two periods we are considering, relates
to the <em>coin</em>. In the first, the value of <em>it</em> had been very well preserved:
no considerable alteration had been made upon <em>it</em>, from
1602 to 1636, that the Cardinal raised the denomination of the
marc of fine silver, from 22 livres to 27 livres 10 sols, as has been
said. Whereas from the revolution, until the establishment of the
bank in 1695, the <em>coin</em> had suffered in England a debasement, from
clipping, of near 50 <i>per cent.</i> This circumstance, more than any
other, affected the credit of England, and increased the expence
of King William’s war. In Richlieu’s time, circulation and trade
had made more progress in France than in England at the time
Davenant lived. The revenue left by Henry the Fourth was double
to that of England at the revolution: and, in general, the income
of the Kings of France had far exceeded that of the Kings of
England, for many reigns before that of the great Henry. Borrowing
also, upon a fixed and permanent interest, had been known
in France so far back as Francis the First.</p>

<p class='c001'>That Prince was the first, I find, who contracted a regular
debt, at perpetual interest, upon the town-house of Paris, at about
8 <i>per cent.</i> when the legal interest in England, under his contemporary
Henry the Eighth, was 10 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The predecessor of Francis, Louis XII. had of gross revenue,
charged with his debts, which eat up near one half, above
2,500,000<i>l.</i> sterling. Dutot, Reflex. Pol. Vol. I. p. 204. Francis I.
left to his successor in 1546, a gross revenue of 2,685,314<i>l.</i> sterling,
and of nett income 2,287,998<i>l.</i> according to Dutot and M. de Sulli.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under Henry II. and Francis II. the gross revenue stood at about
2,618,000<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under Charles the IXth, I have not been able to discover any
thing which can be relied upon: but his successor Henry III. according
to Sulli, had, in 1581, a revenue of 3,250,000<i>l.</i> sterling,
and left only about 16 millions of livres of debt, which was no
great sum.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>To this Henry IV. succeeded; and by the capacity and unwearied
application of his great minister M. de Sulli, it was raised to
above six millions sterling, at the beginning of the reign of Louis
XIII. This revenue, by his wars and expences, was left greatly
incumbered; but still the taxes were established which brought it
in; and so early in the reign of his successor Louis XIV. as the
year 1683, his revenue extended to no less than 9,182,914<i>l.</i> sterling,
according to Dutot. Reflex. Pol. Vol. II. p. 256<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. These sums are all converted into sterling, according to the value of the French
livre at the different periods here mentioned.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Let any man, acquainted in the least with the history of England,
examine the fixed revenue there, under Henry VII. and VIII.
Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, and their successors, down to the
revolution; and they will evidently see the great disproportion of
wealth, proceeding from taxes, in the one and the other kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these facts I conclude, that debts and taxes in France were
much more familiarly known in Richlieu’s time, than possibly they
could be in England when Davenant wrote.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public credit had long grown up in that kingdom, under the
hard influence of regal power: whereas in this it had sprung
up lately, under the protection of liberty, and a most limited authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>To that cause I ascribe the difference we find between the principles
of English and French credit; and to an effect similar to the
cause I ascribe the gigantic steps by which Britain has outstripped
her powerful rival in the establishment of her credit, since the beginning
of this century.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is folly to prophecy, I know; but I may be allowed to conjecture,
that the same causes which have raised the credit of this
nation to such an amazing height, will either force the French
from their old principles, or they will, some time or other, bury
her credit in the dust.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had one half of the acts of power been exerted with us, which
have been so familiar in France: had half the liberties been taken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>in tampering with the claims of creditors; a total bankruptcy
would long ere now have been the consequence: but in Britain
credit is young; and has been tenderly reared. In France she is
old, and has been accustomed for many ages to rougher usage.
But example works wonderful effects, especially when nations live
together in this great European society; and the advantages of a
security to be depended on will every day more and more engage
the money’d interest to prefer this to any violent and precarious
profits.</p>

<p class='c001'>How nicely does not Davenant employ political arithmetic, in
order to make true estimates of the taxes to be imposed, and
appropriated for a term of years, for extinguishing principal
and interest? How exactly has not the account between the state
and the bank been carried on from 1695, to this day? How faithfully
have not all parliamentary engagements been observed?
When, in 1749, a most natural operation was performed, to reduce
the interest of the debt of Great Britain, by gentle steps, from
4 to 3 <i>per cent.</i> what an outcry did it not make, although an alternative
was left to the creditors, either to receive an actual reimbursement,
or to accept of the new terms? The credit of Great
Britain must have appeared to France in the light of a pettish child,
educated in the house of a too indulgent parent: her own is not
treated with such gentleness; and when our money-jobbers try
their hand at Paris, and meet with disappointments from unexpected
acts of council; to prevent the laugh going against them,
for trusting to the credit of France, they turn it off by a jest, and
pretend that they were only playing as at the Groom-Porter’s, or in
Change-Alley.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a word, what would totally ruin the credit of England, does
not equally affect that of France. An act of power there, no
doubt, throws a damp upon it for a time; and if that act of power
takes place at a critical juncture, it may cost her very dear; as it
has lately cost her the continent of North America; which, I think,
was sold for 32 millions, withheld from her creditors, for a short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>time, in the end of 1759. But this act of power, and many others
since, have not ruined the credit of France: many trust her still;
only those who purchase in her funds, at present, take about 2 <i>per
cent.</i> off from their interest, as a premium for the insurance of her
good faith, until she recovers her mercantile reputation<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. Money invested in the French funds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1766, will bring the purchaser 6 <i>per
cent.</i> This I consider as 4 <i>per cent.</i> for the interest, and 2 <i>per cent.</i> premium for the
risk; and were she now to borrow any considerable sums, I suppose the insurance would
rise in proportion.</p>
</div>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.4.5' class='c015'>CHAP. V.<br /><i>Of the present state of public Credit in Great Britain.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We have, in a preceeding chapter, given a general view of the
state of public credit in England, at the end of the last century.
In this, I shall briefly run through the most remarkable revolutions,
both in sentiments and events, which have succeeded since
that time.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the revolution the revenue of England was about two millions
sterling, affected by two debts. The first was called the bankers
debt, contracted by Charles II. and, by letters patent, charged upon
his hereditary excise, to the amount of upwards of 1 300 000<i>l.</i>
This debt was reduced to one half, in the last years of King William,
and put at 6 <i>per cent.</i> perpetual annuity, to commence from 1706.
The other was a debt of 60,000<i>l.</i> due to that Prince’s servants, neglected
to be paid by his successor, and discharged after the revolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the peace of Ryswick, the national debt amounted to about
20 millions. The branches of taxes subsisting at the revolution, and
continued till then, produced no more than about 800,000<i>l</i>.; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>by additional taxes laid on in the reign of King William, the whole
revenue extended to 3 355 499<i>l.</i> of which above one million was to
cease before 1700, as has been said. This reduced the revenue, at
the beginning of Queen Anne’s reign, to nearly what it had been
at the revolution: out of which if we deduct the interest of the national
debt then subsisting, and the expence of the civil list, we shall
discover the extent of the funds prepared for engaging in the war
with France; and then by comparing the state of the nation at her
succession, with what it was at her death, we shall form a general
notion of the progress of credit, debts and taxes in England during
that period.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. The Queen got from parliament 700,000l. for her civil list; but she immediately
ordered 100,000l. to be annually paid to the uses of the war.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What the exact amount of the revenue of England was at the
death of the Queen, I cannot justly say. But as it may be comprehended
under the three general branches of customs, excises, and
other inland duties, we may form a guess at it, though imperfectly
I allow, from the number of articles in each.</p>

<p class='c001'>At her accession, the customs comprehended fifteen articles; at
her death they amounted to thirty-seven: at her accession, the excises
comprehended ten articles; at her death, they amounted to
twenty-seven: at her accession, the other inland duties comprehended
eight articles; at her death, they amounted to sixteen, including
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>the land tax, then become in a manner perpetual, although laid
on from year to year.</p>

<p class='c001'>At her accession, the public debts amounted (as above) to near
seven millions, at her death they exceeded fifty millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>In fourteen years, from the revolution to her accession, the money
granted by parliament, partly raised on the subject, and partly
borrowed, or taken credit for, according to the custom of the times,
amounted to above fifty-five millions. During the 13 years of
Queen Anne, the money granted by parliament raised on the subject,
or borrowed as above, amounted to upwards of 80 millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this general sketch I do not mean to enter into exact details:
facts must be sought for in books which treat of facts; our chief
object is to examine the principles upon which the public credit
was supported, let the exact sum of money raised be what it will.</p>

<p class='c001'>The expences of the French war first engaged the nation to revive
those taxes which had been suppressed; and to impose many
others for a considerable number of years, in proportion to the money
borrowed upon them, according to the principles of the former
reign.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1702, interest was so low, that government got money at 5
<i>per cent.</i> It continued so till 1704, when some loans began to be
made at 6 <i>per cent.</i> and at this rate it stood during the war.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in 1706, the exigencies of government were far greater than
what all the money to be borrowed, or raised on the subject, could
supply. This opened a door to the abuse of paying the growing
deficiencies upon the taxes with exchequer bills, chargeable on distant
funds. These fell constantly to great discount; and the unhappy
servants of the state, who received them in payment, were
obliged to dispose of them to people who could wait for an usurious
reimbursement by parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'>When those exchequer bills had once got into the hands of the
monied people, they had interest with government to engage the
bank to circulate them at 6 <i>per cent.</i> interest: but as the funds upon
which they were secured happened at that time, 1706, to be engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>for discharging debts previously contracted, the bank, during
that interval, could receive no payment of this interest of 6 <i>per
cent.</i> so the expedient fallen upon, was to pay the bank compound
interest for all the tallies and bills they were to discount, until the
funds appropriated should be relieved.</p>

<p class='c001'>This expedient, bad as it was, and burdensome to the state in the
highest degree, proved of infinite service, both in establishing the
credit of exchequer bills, and relieving those who received payment
in them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This operation was quite similar to those of banks of circulation
upon mortgage. The bank of England was here employed in converting
into money exchequer bills, secured upon the faith of government.
Banks upon mortgage convert into money the property
of individuals, upon private security. Had, therefore, banks upon
mortgage been established in England at this time, all those who
had property would have got credits from them, and would have
been enabled thereby to pay their taxes, and carry on their industry,
without diminishing their consumption. The exchequer would then
have had no occasion to issue discredited bills and tallies for making
up deficiencies; because taxes would have been productive, and
the state would have been relieved of this excessive burden of
interest at 6 <i>per cent.</i> accumulated quarterly in favour of the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>What extraordinary profit must have accrued to the bank by this
operation, every one must perceive. They were not here procuring
funds to lend at a great expence; all they did was to augment the
quantity of their paper upon government security; which they
knew well would be suspended in the common circle of payments
within the country; and the public borrowings were sufficient to
furnish credit for the sums sent out of the country. In this view
we may conclude, that almost the whole accumulated interest paid,
was pure profit to the bank, and a great augmentation of the national
debt.</p>

<p class='c001'>This operation of the bank in 1706, did not prevent subsequent
deficiencies, in the payment of the navy, army, ordnance, and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>many other articles. In 1710, they amounted to above nine millions
sterling. This was too great a sum to be borrowed; and the
bank durst not venture to discount more than what domestic circulation
could suspend: so that after this great debt had circulated
upon the discredited obligations which had been issued for it, and
in that way had fallen again into the hands of monied people, at
30 and 40 <i>per cent.</i> below par, the new proprietors of it were all incorporated
into one great company, with a governor and directors,
who got 6 <i>per cent.</i> for the whole capital, with an allowance of
8000<i>l.</i> a year for charges of management.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus all the real creditors for these deficiencies lost the discount;
the monied people gained it, and the public paid for all.</p>

<p class='c001'>When credit is in this languid state, every expence of government
rises in proportion to the discredit of the paper with which they
pay, till at last the whole sum, with interest, accumulation, and
expence, falls upon the state, as if every farthing of it had been
frugally expended in ready money.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a general view of the state of credit in Queen Anne’s reign.</p>

<p class='c001'>Government had not, as in the former war, the inconveniences
flowing from the disorder in the coin to combat with. These contributed
more than any other circumstance, to raise the capital of the
debts at the peace of Ryswick. Circulation, too, was considerably
augmented, in consequence of the increase of taxes, public debts,
and the operation of the bank in circulating exchequer bills and
tallies. Yet money was still scarce, in comparison of what it might
have been, had proper methods been contrived to preserve it upon
a level with the occasions for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The incorporation, also, of nine millions capital in the hands of a
corporation, which afterwards was called the South Sea Company,
was an assistance to public credit, by increasing a monied interest, the
principal view of which was to fill the government loans, on the
lucrative conditions offered for them. And last of all, the strictly
adhering to the public faith of engagements, without seeking,
by acts of power, to indemnify the state for the losses it had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>obliged to incur, from the circumstances of the times, laid the
solid basis of national credit for the future.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the many additional taxes added to the former revenue,
did not increase it in any proportion to the load laid upon the subject
during this war, they served, however, as a good foundation
for improvement, as soon as the effects of peace restored them to
their full production. But the charges laid upon them having become
every year greater, government was obliged to engage certain
funds for thirty two years to come, and sometimes longer; and
many branches of taxes, which formerly had been granted for
short terms, were then made perpetual. After the peace of
Utrecht, the expences of the state were greatly diminished, and
money began to regorge: so that in the year 1716, the first foundation
of the sinking fund was laid, by opening a subscription for
paying off about ten or eleven millions sterling, at that time,
charged upon several branches of taxes, the produce of which
amounted annually to 724 849<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proprietors of these debts were allowed to subscribe into this
new fund, at an interest of 5 <i>per cent.</i> redeemable by parliament:
and in case the whole subscription should not fill at that rate, the
bank and South Sea company became bound to make it up, upon
receiving a like annuity in proportion to their subscriptions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bankers debt, of which we have spoken, the only public
debt owing at the revolution, made part of those which were to be
subscribed for.</p>

<p class='c001'>The taxes which had been appropriated for the discharge of those
capitals, from temporary, were made perpetual; with a clause
added, that when the surplus of the fund, after payment of interest,
had discharged the capitals of all the national debt due the 25th of
December in that year, the whole produce of the fund itself should
remain at the disposal of parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'>After this first operation in reducing the interest, the bank was
satisfied with a reduction to 5 <i>per cent.</i> of that paid to them; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>they began to circulate exchequer bills at a more moderate interest
than formerly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public credit was now daily gaining ground. In 1719, the South
Sea company, whose capital was then swelled to eleven millions at
5 <i>per cent.</i> with a sum of 9397<i>l.</i> sterling for the expence of management,
enlarged their views; and finding great profits to arise from
such a fund under one administration, formed a project of acquiring
a large sum of the public debts, which remained outstanding
upon the original funds appropriated for them.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this purpose they proposed to government to acquire, 1. The
property of above 16 millions of redeemable debts, bearing then
4 and 5 <i>per cent.</i> interest; and to reduce the whole to 4 <i>per cent.</i> at
midsummer 1727. 2. To acquire a sum of 794 000<i>l.</i> of annuities
upon lives, and for long terms, as they should agree with
the proprietors, at 5 <i>per cent.</i> upon the purchase-money, until
1727; and at 4 <i>per cent.</i> afterwards. Annuities were then valued at
fourteen and twenty years purchase, according to their length:
they rose, however, during the operations of the South Sea, to 25
and 30 years purchase. 3. They were to have a sum added to their
former allowance for the charge of management, in proportion
to this augmentation of their stock. 4. That for the advantage
which might follow upon this agreement with government, they
were to pay into the exchequer above seven millions sterling, toward
discharging other national debts outstanding. And in the last
place, they engaged to circulate a considerable sum of exchequer
bills, and to pay the interest of 2 pence <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per cent. per diem</i></span>, which
should grow upon them during seven years<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. After the long and particular account I have given of the Missisippi, I shall not
enter into a like detail, concerning a scheme which proceeded upon the very same principles;
to wit, the artificial raising the value of a stock, by promising dividends, out
of funds which were nowise proportioned to them.
I shall therefore, in a very few words, compare some of the operations of the South
Sea scheme, with those of the Missisippi; and in doing it, point out the principal differences
between them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great profits upon the Missisippi were expected from the interest paid by government
for the great loan, the farms of the revenue, and the profits upon their trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those of the South Sea were, at setting out, 1. The profits upon their trade: 2.
The allowance made them: 3. The difference of receiving 5 <i>per cent.</i> for the money
they laid out in purchasing the public debts, when money was at 4 <i>per cent.</i> as it was
when the scheme was set on foot: and 4. The surplus money subscribed into the stock
above par, in consequence of the artifices used to enhance the value of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The seven millions they were to pay to the state, seemingly for no value received,
were a sort of compensation for receiving the 5 <i>per cent.</i> for 7 years, at a time when
money was worth no more than 4 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>These advantages raised, at first, the value of the original stock of eleven millions.
The consequence was, that the proprietors of the 16 millions of the redeemable debts,
which were to be bought in when they came to subscribe their capitals into the new
stock, transacted them at a proportional discount; which discount, being good against
the government in favour of the company, served to discharge proportionally the seven
millions the company was to pay. This gave an additional value to the stock; and so
it rose, greatly indeed above that proportion. Then the company promised a dividend
of 10 <i>per cent.</i> for one half year, upon their capital, at midsummer 1720; this dividend
was to be paid in stock, which was constantly rising in its value; but no information
was ever given the public concerning the funds which were to produce this dividend;
so every one concluded that there were hidden treasures in their hands, which
enabled them to promise such large dividends. Accordingly, stock rose from 300 <i>per
cent.</i> to 375; then to 400, and at last to 1000 <i>per cent.</i>; and in proportion as it rose,
the wealth of the former subscribers augmented from the surplus above par, paid by
the latter, and those who subscribed last, bore all the loss upon the blowing up of
the scheme.</p>

<p class='c001'>But one great difference between the South Sea and Missisippi, was this: That in
France there was abundance of money in the hands of the public, for purchasing the
actions, at the exorbitant price to which they rose; but in England there was not:
consequently, in France, the rate of interest fell to 2 <i>per cent.</i> and in England, the great
demand for money to borrow, raised it beyond all bounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who subscribed in money, paid down no more than 10 <i>per cent.</i> at subscribing;
but became bound to pay up the remainder. But when the stock tumbled, people
were better pleased to lose the 10 <i>per cent.</i> they had paid, than to pay up the remaining
90 <i>per cent.</i> according to the terms at subscribing. Those indeed who subscribed their
former capitals at a vast discount, did not labour under the same inconvenience of want
of money; but that discount became as real a loss to <em>them</em>, as the cash subscribed became
a loss to the money subscribers, the moment that those who were in the secret,
and who, by the most infamous chain of artifices, had blown up the public frenzy,
began to realize and sell out, and that the whole was discovered to be a cheat. So that
upon the whole, the English scheme had much less foundation than the French. The
first blew up from an absolute necessity, and for want of any bottom at all; the last
from misconduct, and rather from folly than knavery. I return to an account of the
scheme.</p>

<p class='c001'>The original capital of the South Sea company, was 11 750 000<i>l.</i>: the redeemable
debts they were to purchase in, amounted to 16 750 000<i>l.</i>; and the value of the irredeemable,
or what were called the <em>absolute terms</em>, was computed at 15 058 000<i>l.</i>
together 31 808 000<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proprietors of this original capital of 11 750 000<i>l.</i> consulted their own advantage
only, in purchasing in this large sum of debts, which were to be converted
into additional stock; and therefore sounded very high the great advantages of such a
transformation of them; 1<i>mo</i>, From the profits of the trade, which they were to enjoy
exclusively. And, 2<i>do</i>, From the great addition to their wealth, from the constant
rising in the price of their stock. They carried their views to nothing less than
obtaining a majority in the house of commons, by the weight of their wealth, and of
becoming the absolute rulers of the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The public being from the beginning intoxicated with such ideas, subscriptions for
stock were opened at 200 <i>per cent.</i> above par; and some of the proprietors of the
31 808 000<i>l.</i> subscribed at first their capitals at a proportional discount; that is, they
made over a debt of 100<i>l.</i> for 33⅓ in South Sea stock; and successively, the subscription
rose to 1000 <i>per cent.</i> These immense profits being incorporated into the
gains of the general stock, were proportionally shared by the subscribers themselves,
who became proprietors; and the higher the stock rose, the more these gains augmented.
This influenced the infatuation; and the dividends augmenting in proportion
to the price of subscription, there appeared no end of the rising of the stock.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first dividend offered, as has been said, was 10 <i>per cent.</i> half-yearly, in stock:
this was afterwards converted into no less than 30 <i>per cent.</i> in money, for that half-year:
and when stock rose to 1000, a dividend of no less than 50 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per cent. per annum</i></span>,
in money, was promised for twelve years to come.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had stock risen to 2000 <i>per cent.</i> the dividend could have as easily been carried to
100 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per cent. per annum</i></span>, as it had been to 50 <i>per cent.</i> when at 1000.</p>

<p class='c001'>But whence was this dividend to be paid? The company and the directors took
good care never to give to the public any light as to that particular.</p>

<p class='c001'>To prevent, therefore, such abuses in the rising of the South Sea, it ought to have
been provided by parliament, that in taking in subscriptions, and offering dividends, the
directors should have informed the public, 1<i>mo</i>, Of the money owing to them by government.
2<i>do</i>, Of the money gained by the subscriptions above par. And 3<i>tio</i>, Of
the profits upon their trade. And, on the other hand, of the debts due by them; and
of the nett balance upon their books, in their favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>This would have been fair dealing. But to pretend the necessity of secrecy, in a
point where a nation is interested, was in itself a mere pretext; and had it been otherwise,
it might have been answered, that a company which is obliged to have recourse to
such secrets, ought to be prevented from dealing with those who were to remain ignorant
of <em>them</em>, however deeply interested.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>From the operations we have been describing, we perceive, that
the point of view in England, from the peace of Utrecht, has always
been to reduce the interest of the national debt; but never to leave
in the hands of the creditors, any part of the savings made; in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>to diminish the capital. These savings have constantly been thrown
into a sinking fund, <em>supposed</em> to be intended for extinguishing the
capital; and were it employed for that purpose for a few years
only, and not diverted to other uses, I am persuaded the consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>would be, to reduce interest in England lower than ever perhaps
it has been seen in any nation. That interest may be reduced, by
making money regorge in the hands of the lenders, is, I think,
an uncontroverted principle: that by regorging in France, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1720,
it reduced interest to 2 <i>per cent.</i> is a fact indisputable. I shall not
pretend to say positively, that the total appropriation of the sinking
fund, and an augmentation upon annual grants, to make up the
void, would in Great Britain work this effect in a few years; but
I think it is very probable that it would: and if the domestic creditors,
in any state, where debts, <em>due to strangers</em>, are swelled to such
a height as to exceed the whole profits made upon trade, shall by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>their influence, and from a motive of present advantage, obstruct
a scheme of this nature; the consequence will prove, in the first
place, to discourage, and then totally to extinguish commerce, and
in a little time to occasion an unavoidable bankruptcy; as shall be
farther explained in a succeeding chapter. I return to the South
Sea company.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proposal of the South Sea company, mentioned above, was
accepted of, and ratified by act of parliament, 6 Geo. I. chap. 4th.
But the disaster which befel credit, in consequence of the ambitious
views of those who were in the administration of that company,
prevented the nation from reaping all the advantages which might
have proceeded from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reign of K. George I. though little disturbed by foreign wars,
produced not the smallest diminution upon the capital of the public
debts; and those which subsisted at the peace of Utrecht, stood, at
his death, at 50 354 953<i>l.</i> The same taxes subsisted; and every one
almost was by this time made perpetual, except indeed the land tax
and malt duty, which to this day continue to be annual grants.</p>

<p class='c001'>But alas! this apparent revenue, arising from a multitude of
taxes, was of no use towards defraying the smallest <em>extraordinary</em>
expence of government. Every article of it was engaged for
debts; and the operations for reducing the interest were calculated
only to produce a fund for discharging the capital. The civil list,
indeed, that is to say, the expence of civil government, exclusive
of army, navy, ordnance, and incidental articles, was paid from
the permanent taxes, and considered as a charge upon them. But
were not armies and navies then become as regular an expence
upon every state in Europe as judges and ambassadors? Undoubtedly
they were. Yet after the peace of Utrecht, in laying down
the plan which has constantly been followed ever since, for defraying
the regular expence of British government, these two great
and unavoidable expences were considered as contingent only, and
provided for by annual grants: and because armies, in time of
peace, in former reigns, had proved dangerous to liberty from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>the abuse of power, they were still considered in the same light,
at a time when liberty and trade were continually threatened from
their armed enemies and rivals abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the continuance of peace, in the reign of George the First,
had produced the effect of reducing interest, on many occasions, to
3 <i>per cent.</i> the sinking fund began to gather strength. The land
tax, from the year 1722, had not exceeded two shillings in the
pound; and the <em>extraordinary</em> expence of government, according to
the annual grants of the 13 years of his reign, did not exceed
34 800 000<i>l.</i> or 2 670 000<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public tranquillity was very little disturbed during the first twelve
years of the succeeding reign; and all the <em>extraordinary</em> expence did
not much exceed three millions <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>: yet that expence, small
as it was, compared with what it has been since, was almost every
year made out, by taking one million at least from the sinking
fund; and in the years of the least expence, such as 1731 and 1732,
the land tax was reduced to one shilling in the pound, at the expence
of taking two millions and a half from the sinking fund.</p>

<p class='c001'>These steps of administration I neither censure, or approve of.
I must suppose every statesman to have good reasons for doing what
he does, unless I can discover that his motives are bad. May not
the landed interest, who composed the parliament, have insisted
upon such a diminution of their load? May not the proprietors of
the public debts have insisted on their side, that no money out
of the sinking fund should be thrown into their hands, while
the bank was making loans upon the land and malt duties at 3 <i>per
cent.</i>? Might not the people have  been averse to an augmentation of
taxes? When three such considerable interests concur in a scheme,
which in its ultimate, though distant consequences, must end in
the notable prejudice of perpetuating the debts, although opportunities
offer to diminish them, what can government do? They
must submit; and which is worse, they cannot well avow their
reasons.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>Such combinations must occur, and frequently too, in every
state loaded with debts, where the body of the people, the landlords,
and the creditors, find an advantage in the non-payment of the
national debt. It is for this reason that I imagine, the best way
to obviate the bad consequences of so strong an influence in parliament,
would be, to appropriate the amount of all sinking funds
in such a manner, as to put it out of a nation’s power to misapply
them, and by this force them either to retrench their extraordinary
expences, or to impose taxes for defraying them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second period of George IId’s reign, was from the breaking
out of the Spanish war in 1739, to the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in
1748. During these ten years, (1748 being included) the extraordinary
expence was, upon an average, very near seven millions;
and at the end of the year 1738, the public debts amounted to
46 661 767<i>l.</i> bearing 1 962 053<i>l.</i> interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first expedient for borrowing money during the war, was to
continue the duty on salt for seven years; and to mortgage it at
once for 1 200 000<i>l.</i> according to the old plan. To this was added,
the expedient of lotteries, and loans upon indeterminate annuities,
according to the current value of money.</p>

<p class='c001'>An additional excise upon spirituous liquors, brought in wherewithal
to compensate these additional sums of interest; and
the East India company, for lending one million at 3 <i>per cent.</i>
upon this occasion, had their charter continued from 1766 to 1780.
This operation I also consider as an anticipation; and as it was to
commence at the distance of 23 years from the time of the grant,
could not fail of being very burdensome to the nation, however
convenient it might be at that particular time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were the India company now, 1766, to purchase the renewal of
their charter for 14 years, what a sum might be expected from it!
Yet the value given for the grant they then obtained did not exceed
30 000<i>l.</i> because the other annuities of 3 <i>per cent.</i> were sold at that
time for 97<i>l.</i> or, in the language of the funds, at 3<i>l.</i> premium
for every 100<i>l.</i> subscribed; and this so early in the war as 1743.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>The practice of borrowing upon premiums had taken place in
Queen Anne’s reign, and has of late years been very common.
The credit of Great Britain is so firmly established, that in whatever
way government inclines to borrow, the money’d men are
willing to lend, provided the loan be made at the then rate of
interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>To avoid therefore the establishment of funds at different rates,
in proportion to the fluctuations of money, the bargain is made
at one determinate interest. Suppose, for an example, 3 <i>per cent.</i>
Then, according as it is found to rise above that rate in the market,
a premium is paid out of the money subscribed; as in this
case 3<i>l.</i> was paid out of the 100<i>l.</i> subscribed; that is, the subscriber
retained it, and obtained his 3<i>l.</i> annuity, for the payment
of 97<i>l.</i> so this remained a 3 <i>per cent.</i> loan, instead of being, as it
really was, at 3<sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>97</sub> <i>per cent.</i> and was sold and transferred as every
other 3 <i>per cent.</i> without occasioning any perplexity.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the war continued, interest rose, from the demand for money,
when the supplies became deficient.</p>

<p class='c001'>The year following, viz. 1744, this manifested itself, by the conditions
offered by government, which were: That, of two millions
to be borrowed at 3 <i>per cent.</i> as before, upon the whole sum,
1 500 000<i>l.</i> should be formed into perpetual annuities, and the remaining
500 000<i>l.</i> into a lottery, consisting of 50,000 tickets, to be
sold at 10<i>l.</i> each. The original subscribers to this loan subscribed
therefore 10<i>l.</i> for the ticket, and 30<i>l.</i> for the annuity, in all 40<i>l.</i>;
for which they were to receive 3 <i>per cent.</i> But the premium consisted
in this; that every subscriber for 10 tickets, that is, 400<i>l.</i> of
the total fund, had an annuity for life given to him of 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>This made five thousand annuities on lives, of 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> each, or
22 500<i>l.</i> a year to be added to the interest of 3 <i>per cent.</i> on the two
millions, that is, to 60 000<i>l.</i> a year of perpetual annuities. So that
the whole loan of two millions this year cost government 82 500<i>l.</i>
of interest, or 4⅛ <i>per cent.</i>; 22 500<i>l.</i> of which was to extinguish
with the lives of the subscribers.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>Now, if we suppose these life-annuities worth 20 years purchase<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a>,
this was the same thing as if government had given a deduction
of 90<i>l.</i> out of the 400<i>l.</i> subscribed; consequently the remainder,
which was 310<i>l.</i> produced 12<i>l.</i> This makes the rate of interest
upon the loan to have been 3.87 <i>per cent.</i> And as government inclined
that the loan should be made in that way, the lenders were
willing that it should be so; and the difference between 3.87 <i>per
cent.</i> (the then rate of money) and 4⅛ interest, which was paid by
government, was a sinking fund, as it were, for the gradual extinction
of the capital of the lottery for 500,000<i>l.</i> during the lives
of the annuitants.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1746, perpetual or <a id='corr394.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='determinate'>indeterminate</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_394.12'><ins class='correction' title='determinate'>indeterminate</ins></a></span> annuities were constituted at
4 <i>per cent.</i> and the premium upon the ten lottery tickets was raised
to 9<i>l.</i> life-annuity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be unnecessary to trace the various methods of contriving
the premiums given in the succeeding years of this war.
The principle upon which they were regulated was always to proportion
them to the rate of interest at the time; and the motive
was, I suppose, that by this method of borrowing, a part at least
of the debt would become extinguished with the lives of the subscribers.
There might perhaps be another, to wit, that by swelling
the capital, for value not received, there was an appearance of
borrowing at a lower rate of interest than what in reality was the
case. Thus in 1747, when 6 300 000<i>l.</i> were borrowed, instead of
giving not quite 4½ <i>per cent.</i> for this sum, they gave 4 <i>per cent.</i> upon
6 930 000<i>l.</i> which capital, although money should return to 3 <i>per
cent.</i> was still to stand at its full value; whereas, had 6 300 000<i>l.</i> been
borrowed at 4½ <i>per cent.</i> there would have been a saving of 600 000<i>l.</i>
upon the capital; and at the peace, the interest of 4½ <i>per cent.</i>
would equally have come down to 3 <i>per cent.</i> with the other funds.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. This may seem a high valuation, and is, in fact, far beyond what any of those
annuities sold for: but as the interest of money cannot be estimated, for a constancy,
at more than 3 <i>per cent.</i> and that probably the best lives were chosen, the value to government
of such annuities may well be estimated at 20 years purchase. By De Moivre’s
tables, annuities for the most favourable ages, interest being at 3 <i>per cent.</i> are valued
at 19.87 years purchase; and his valuations are generally allowed not to be too high.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>During this first war of George the Second, the land-tax was
constantly at 4<i>s.</i> in the pound; and new branches of customs, excise,
or other inland duties, were created in proportion to the
swelling of the national debts, which, on the 31st of December
1748, amounted to 78 293 313<i>l.</i> sterling, bearing 3 005 325<i>l.</i> interest;
and the sinking fund, or surplus of all permanent taxes then imposed,
after paying the civil list, and the interest upon this capital,
amounted to 1 060 948<i>l.</i> sterling. During this war, the debts were
increased above what they were at the end of 1738, by 31 631 546<i>l.</i>
sterling capital, and by 1 043 272<i>l.</i> of interest or annuities.</p>

<p class='c001'>The war was no sooner over, and the national expence diminished,
than money began to regorge in the hands of the monied interest: an
infallible consequence of such a violent revolution, when extraneous
circumstances, such as occurred after the peace 1763, do not prevent it.</p>

<p class='c001'>To profit of this conjuncture, government, early in 1749, proposed
that all the public creditors upon capitals bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i>
interest, redeemable by parliament, and amounting to upwards of
57 millions, who should accept of 3 <i>per cent.</i> from December 1757,
should have their debts made irredeemable until that time; and in
the interval should continue to have 4 <i>per cent.</i> till December 1750;
and 3½ <i>per cent.</i> from thence, until the total reduction to <i>per cent.</i>
in December 1757.</p>

<p class='c001'>This bold undertaking had the desired effect. Many obstacles
were thrown in the way; but the regorging capitals in the hands
of many, made every one fear the reimbursement for himself;
and the credit of France was then so low, that very few chose its
funds as an outlet for their superfluous money.</p>

<p class='c001'>But an outlet, unfortunately, was not wanting at the end of the
last war in 1763, as we shall shew in its proper place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here then is a notable instance of the effects of regorging money.
A small sum, when compared with a nation’s debt, operates
upon the whole capital; as a small balance upon trade affects the
whole mass of reciprocal payments.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reimbursement of 57 millions offered by government, in
1749, was, to the conviction of all the world, an impracticable
scheme; but the stockholders seeing a large sum ready to be subscribed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>at the interest offered, and feeling the effects which that
regorging money must, in all events, have produced, willingly,
and wisely perhaps, consented to the offer made them. Had they
refused, and had the scheme proposed become abortive thereby,
perhaps the nation might have been so far animated against the
creditors, from the disappointment, as to have consented to be at
the expence of defraying the service of the following years, without
encroaching upon the sinking fund. What effect this would have
produced upon the rate of interest, in that conjuncture, no man can
tell, nor will the real consequence of such a measure ever be known,
until the happy trial be made. That it would have brought interest
below 3 <i>per cent.</i> in December 1757, is, I think, evident: for as
matters stood, had the creditors of 57 millions been able to hold
out, I must do them the justice to believe, they would not have
consented to the proposal made to them; and an addition of all
the sinking fund thrown among them annually, at a time they
could not dispose of what they had, upon better terms than those
offered them, would undoubtedly then, as at all times, operate a
very great national relief, in bringing down the interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the tranquillity which continued from the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
in 1748, to the commencement of hostilities in 1755,
the money expended for extraordinary services amounted on
an average to above four millions <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>. The expence of
government was then increased, by supporting the colonies, and
by several great and uncommon outgoings at home, for purposes
mentioned in the supplies of those years.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little before the breaking out of the last war, that is to say, on
the 5th of January 1755, the national funded debt was reduced to
72 289 674<i>l.</i> upon which was paid an annuity of 2 654 500<i>l.</i> and
the sinking fund amounted to 1 308 814<i>l</i><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a>. At the end of 1763,
the year of the peace, the funded debt amounted to 130 586 789<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
besides above 9 millions not provided for. So that at the end of
last war the national debt exceeded 140 millions; besides the value
of the annuities granted in 1757, 1761, and 1762. Hence it appears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>that the war occasioned an augmentation of upwards of
58 297 116<i>l.</i> upon the funded national debt; besides the difference
between the unfunded debts at the beginning and end of the war;
and also the value of those annuities<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. To this funded debt must be added the unfunded debt, which I do not know
exactly; and the value of the annuities granted in 1745, and 1746.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. The annuities of 1757, are estimated, by the author of the Considerations on
Trade and the Finances, at 472 500<i>l.</i> or at 14 years purchase; and the annuities of
1761, 1762, at 6 826 875<i>l.</i> or at 27½ years purchase. But this valuation seems too
low, for the reasons given in the note, p. 394.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I shall, before I conclude this chapter, present a short scheme of the
state of the nation at that time: but first let us take a view of the methods
used to borrow so large a sum in the short period of eight years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Until 1757, money was borrowed by government, at a little
above 3 <i>per cent.</i> but then a loan of 5 millions being necessary, government
consented to create annuities of 4½ <i>per cent.</i> irredeemable
for 24 years. By this expedient the monied people eluded the
operation of reducing the interest of this fund, upon the return
of peace. How far this expedient was to be preferred to the
former, of increasing the capital beyond the money paid; or
whether it would not have been still better to have paid for the
money wanted, according to the current rate of interest in the
market at the time, waiting until a peace might afford a favourable
opportunity of reducing it, I shall not take upon me to determine.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have observed how rash it is for any one to censure acts of administration,
when the motives of a statesman’s conduct are unknown.
This, however, I have sometimes ventured to do, in speaking
of things which happened many years ago; but we ought to
be more cautious as we come nearer to our own times, because
not having, as in this case, a course of experience to point out the
errors, we must entirely rely upon our own sagacity, and reason
only from analogy.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the last war, as in that preceeding it, taxes were increased
in proportion to the interest of the money borrowed; and new impositions
were now laid on the articles of great consumption, which
produced abundantly. The new malt-duty of 3<i>d.</i> <i>per</i> bushel, and
the new beer-duty of 3<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> barrel, bring in net into the exchequer
near 820 000<i>l.</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>, and discharge the interest of above 27
millions sterling, at 3 <i>per cent.</i> Such a sum raised at the end of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>war so very expensive, and at the very time when the credit of
France was totally fallen, must have operated in the strongest manner,
and did in fact operate more, perhaps, than any other consideration
to put an end to that war, the most glorious that Europe
has beheld since the beginning of this century, or perhaps in any
age whatever: advantageous to Great Britain, notwithstanding all
the expence, providing that the consequences happen to correspond
to what may be reasonably expected.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now set before my reader a short state of the taxes, debts, and
public funds of Great Britain, at this bright period of her history.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the best authority I have been able to procure, the revenue
of the state, considered under the three general branches of customs,
excise, and other inland duties, which comprehend the whole permanent
income of this kingdom, was then as follows:</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. I find that the sinking fund is now estimated at 2 100 000<i>l.</i> by the author of
the Considerations on Trade, &amp;c. above cited. I am also informed that the net produce
of the customs exceeds 2 000 000<i>l.</i> considerably: but 4 600 000<i>l.</i> is rather the
gross than the net produce of the <em>permanent</em> duties of excise; that is, of all the excise
duties, excepting the annual malt-duty. It must also be observed, that the annuities
payable to the national creditors, amounted, the 5th January 1764, to more than
4 720 000<i>l.</i> But on the other hand, the interest of the unfunded 9 millions is rated
too high, as appears from the author above quoted. I cannot pretend to give exact
details. The general sketch here stated is sufficient for my purpose.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>In that state, nearly, stood the affairs of Great Britain after the
conclusion of the peace in 1763.</p>

<p class='c001'>It now only remains to offer some conjectures why, after this
period, money was not found to regorge, as after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
so as to furnish an opportunity of reducing the rate of
interest upon all redeemable debts, and by that of raising the amount
of the sinking fund, and more firmly establishing the national credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the fall of the credit of France towards the end of 1759, Great
Britain had the command of all the money to be lent in Europe;
and accordingly amazing sums were borrowed in 1760, 1761, and
1762. Of the sums borrowed, a great part, no doubt, was the property
of strangers; but they, not being so well acquainted with the
affairs of this nation as the English themselves, instead of subscribing
to the loans, lent the money to our own country people, who,
in hopes of a great rise upon the return of peace, filled the subscriptions
with borrowed money.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence was, that no sooner did the funds begin to rise
after the peace, than every creditor demanded his money of those
who had invested it in the public funds. This obliged the latter to
bring their stock to market, and this again had naturally the effect
of keeping the funds very low. Some, more prudent than the rest,
had borrowed upon a long term of repayment; which had the effect
of putting off still longer the settlement of the funds in the hands
of the real proprietors, and of taking them out of those who only
held them nominally.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides this accidental cause of the low price of the funds, other
circumstances, no doubt, greatly contributed to produce the same
effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>However great the balance of trade, that is, of exportations above
importations, may have been of late in favour of England, still the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>mighty sums drawn out by strangers have certainly, upon the
whole, prevented much money from coming home on the general
or grand balance of payments. While that remains the case, it is
impossible money should regorge at home in the hands of the natives,
and until this happens, there is no hope of seeing the 3 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per
cents.</i></span> above par. But then the rise, small as it is, since the peace,
may encourage us to hope that that time is not far off: for had
the profits of our trade been quite unable to balance the loss
upon our foreign debts, the funds would undoubtedly still continue
to fall, which is demonstrably not the case from the circumstances
of the loan in April 1766, obtained by government, with the assistance
of a lottery indeed, at 3 <i>per cent.</i><a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. The loan of 1766, was 1 500 000<i>l.</i> at 3 <i>per cent.</i> Every subscriber for 100<i>l.</i>
had an annuity of 3 <i>per cent.</i> on 60<i>l.</i> and 4 lottery tickets, valued to them by government
at 10<i>l.</i> each, in all 100<i>l.</i> The prizes and blanks in the lottery amount to
600 000<i>l.</i> and bear 3 <i>per cent.</i> paid by government. The annuities amount to
900 000<i>l.</i> and bear also 3 <i>per cent.</i> The number of tickets are 60 000. Hence, at
10<i>l.</i> each, they amount to 600 000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The advantage government reaps by this way of borrowing, is, that the desire of
gaming, raises the lottery tickets above their value, when thrown into the hands of the
public; and this advanced value being a profit to those who receive them in part of
their subscription, that profit they share with government. Example. In April 1766,
when government borrowed 1 500 000<i>l.</i> at 3 <i>per cent.</i> the 3 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per cents.</i></span> were only at
89: consequently, the difference between 89 and 100, which is 11<i>l.</i> must have been
supposed to be the sum which the subscribers, from the propensity of people to game,
had a reasonable, or rather a certain expectation of gaining upon the sale of 4 lottery
tickets, that is, 2<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> upon every one.</p>

<p class='c001'>To know therefore the real par of a lottery ticket, you must proceed thus: it costs
the subscribers 10<i>l.</i> for which they receive from government 3 <i>per cent.</i> This 10<i>l.</i> as
3 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per cents.</i></span> stood at 89, is worth at that rate no more than 8<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> add to this sum
what the public must pay for the liberty to play, which we have stated above at 2<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>
and you have the exact par of a lottery ticket at 11<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever they sell at above 11<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> is profit to the subscribers, whatever they sell
below 11<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> is a loss to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This profit, though small in appearance, is greatly increased from another circumstance,
viz.
That the subscribers may sell their subscriptions at a time when they have really advanced
but a small part of it. The first payment is commonly of 15 <i>per cent.</i> on their
subscription: when they sell, they make this profit upon the whole capital. Suppose
then 15 <i>per cent.</i> paid in: if the profit upon selling be no more than 1 <i>per cent.</i> upon
the capital, that 1 <i>per cent.</i> turns out no less than 6⅔ <i>per cent.</i> upon the money they
have advanced. Thus a person who is possessed of 1500<i>l.</i> only, may subscribe for
10 000<i>l.</i> in this loan: he pays in his 1500<i>l.</i> and receives his subscription; when he
sells he sells 10 000<i>l.</i> subscription, upon which he gains 1 <i>per cent.</i>: 1 <i>per cent.</i> of
10 000<i>l.</i> is 100<i>l.</i> so (in one month suppose) he gains by this means 100<i>l.</i> for the use
of 1500<i>l.</i> But as a counterbalance for this profit, he runs the risk of the falling of the
subscription, which involves him in a proportional loss if he sells out; or in the inconvenience
of advancing more money than he had to employ in that way, in case he should
prefer keeping his subscription for a longer time, in hopes of a rise in the public funds.
By this mode of borrowing, government profits by the disposition of the people to game.
But this propensity has its bounds, and at present it is found by experience not to exceed
60 000 lottery tickets, or 600 000<i>l.</i> Were, therefore, a subscription of 3 millions
taken in upon the same plan with the present of 1 500 000<i>l.</i> the regorging number of
tickets would so glut the market, that the whole would fall below the par of their supposed
value.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>Here then was an outlet provided for more money than all that
could regorge at home, viz. the payment of those foreign creditors,
to whom the stock-holders were indebted. Besides this, the sale by
government, of such tracts of land in the new acquired islands in
the West Indies, provided another; money was even placed in the
funds of France soon after the peace, until the adventurers were
checked by the operations of the King’s council, in reducing both
capitals and interest upon them, contrary to the original stipulations
with the creditors. A lucky circumstance for Great Britain, as it
forces, in a manner, all the money of the continent into the English
funds, which equally remain a debt upon the nation, whether
high or low in the market.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.4.6' class='c015'>CHAP. VI. <br /> <i>State of the public Credit in France, their Debts, Funds, and Appropriations, at the Peace 1763.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Were it as easy to get information of the political state of
France as of Britain, one might attempt to give such a sketch
of their affairs as we have now done of the other; but when we
consider the lame accounts given by French authors who have
made researches of that kind their particular study, it would be inconsiderate
in a stranger ever to undertake a task so difficult.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France, the finances are considered as a political arcanum, of
great consequence to the state to conceal from vulgar eyes. It is
not long ago, since the farmers of the greatest part of the revenue
used regularly to burn their books at the end of the year, to prevent
the King’s servants from knowing the state of the most essential
part of his affairs. Cardinal de Fleuri abolished this custom,
and obliged them to lay every thing open to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now endeavour to communicate, in as short and distinct a
manner as I can, an idea of the present state of the French revenue;
of the taxes from which it proceeds; of the manner they are administred;
of the purposes to which they are appropriated; and of the
state of the King’s debts at the end of the last war.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this view we shall form a general notion of their public
expences; of their public debts; and of what is most material, of
the resources of that kingdom in time to come.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this purpose, I shall divide the whole revenue of France, that
is, all that is raised on the people, to whatever purpose it may be
applied, into five branches; and after having first explained the
nature of each, I shall give a general detail of them in their order.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first branch is what is called the King’s ordinary revenue.
This is composed of about twelve articles of permanent taxes, supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>to be sufficient for defraying the whole expence of government,
civil and military, in time of peace.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second is composed of all the extraordinary impositions which
were laid upon the people, in consequence of debts contracted in
the former war, ended in 1748.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third, what was imposed during the last war, for the service
of the state, and for paying off the debts then contracted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The debts of France, contracted in periods anterior to those two
wars, are charged on the ordinary revenue, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth branch consists of two articles. The first comprehends
certain perpetual taxes appropriated for certain state expences, not
charged upon the ordinary revenue. The second, what is computed
to be the expence of levying all the taxes, and also the profit
of the farmers: or in other words, what the people pay more than
the public receives from the hands of the tax-gatherers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fifth and last branch, comprehends the taxes paid to the
court of Rome, to the clergy, and to the poor; with other duties
belonging to private persons. Under one or other of these five
branches, may be very properly arranged all the taxes paid by the
French nation.</p>

<p class='c023'>Besides the articles of expence here stated, there are many others,
to which no limit can be set. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>comptant</i></span>, or the King’s private
orders for secret service, and many different expences, form a
great article. Subsidies also to foreign courts: in short, much
more, in all human probability, is spent, than all the produce of
this permanent revenue can answer. So that from this no relief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>from debts can be expected, except so far as it may be augmented
by the falling in of the annuities on lives. But public debts are
to be paid only by funds appropriated for that purpose: and were
this revenue to be relieved of the whole 45 millions of interest
charged upon it, I have little doubt but the King’s expence would
augment in proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall delay making any observation upon the nature of the impositions
which produce this revenue, until we come to the subject
of taxes, to which it naturally belongs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides this ordinary revenue of the Kings of France, which (if
we except 26 600 000 livres, or 1 182 222 <i>l.</i> 4 <i>s.</i> 5¼ <i>d.</i> upon the capitation,
added on account of the war only for a time) may be considered
as their civil list; there are other branches of revenue, which
are to be looked on as extraordinary supplies, imposed for raising
money in time of war, and for paying off the debts contracted,
upon the return of peace. Of this nature are <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dixiemes</i></span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>vingtiemes</i></span>;
taxes very contrary to the spirit of the French nation, and
to which they never have submitted without the greatest reluctance,
and only on very urgent occasions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The credit of France fell very low towards the end of the former
war, which began in 1744, and ended in 1748. The parliament registred
with great unwillingness every edict imposing new burthens.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dixieme</i></span> was a great augmentation of revenue, for the time it
lasted; but being an imposition which the Kings of France never
have been able to make perpetual, it could not be pledged for such
large sums as are required in time of war, and which no nation,
however wealthy, can furnish annually, as they are demanded.</p>

<p class='c001'>To supply, therefore, the want of a fund to be mortgaged, and
consequently the want of public credit, the King’s banker M. de
Monmartel, with other men in business, joined their credit, and
supplied the King’s extraordinary occasions. They opened a sort of
bank <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1745, where they received money at ½ <i>per cent.</i> <i>per</i> month,
the principal payable on demand. This fund gained credit; payments
being regularly made as soon as demanded.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>Upon settling accounts after the peace, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1748, the King was
found indebted to this bank for a vast sum of money. In order to
pay it, lotteries were set on foot. The tickets were given to the
bankers, and they by the sale of them withdrew their own paper,
which was circulating with very good credit on the exchange of
Paris. In order to furnish a fund for this lottery, the King had
interest with the parliament to get a twentieth penny established, or
one shilling in the pound, upon all the revenues of private people in
France, except the clergy, and some hospitals. The same was
charged upon the industry of all corporations of trades and merchants;
and to these was added a capitation upon the Jews.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was thrown into what they call the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>caisse d’amortissement</i></span>, or
sinking fund; and appropriated for paying off the lotteries, and
some of the antient debts which were to be drawn, for this purpose,
by lot; and for other extraordinary expences incurred in consequence
of the war. This tax was to subsist, I believe, till 1767. It
was this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>caisse d’amortissement</i></span> which was shut up in 1759, by which
step a mortal blow was given to French credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides this first twentieth penny, there were five other taxes imposed,
and appropriated during a determinate number of years,
not exceeding 15 in some, 12 in others, for paying off the debts
contracted in the war ended 1748, and for some extraordinary expences
of government.</p>

branch of the French revenue.</p>

<p class='c023'>This branch of revenue appears, by this state, to be totally appropriated
to certain purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>Were appropriations adhered to in France, and could one be
certain that debts are actually discharged, at the period appointed,
in consequence of the appropriation for that purpose, we might
form a better judgment of the <em>actual</em> amount of the debts of
France, than in fact any man can do who is not in the administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this second branch of taxes I consider the twentieth penny,
the two shillings in the pound augmentation upon it, and a like
augmentation upon the double capitation; amounting in all to
above 40 millions a year, as a resource which France may have at
all times, in cases of necessity; although I do not suppose it will
be possible to establish them as a fixed revenue. They will probably,
however, as matters stand, be continued, either in whole
or in part, until the great load of debts, recently contracted, shall
be considerably diminished.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the remaining sum, arising from the posts, leather, and
saltpetre, these I consider as perpetual; because by their nature
they are not burdensome to the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are not to understand that the annual sum of five millions
of livres, appropriated for paying off the capital of 990 millions of
the old annuities, bearing 2½ <i>per cent.</i> stated in art. 1st, was intended
to be applied to these capitals, at the rate they stand. In
France it is supposed that he who gets 20 years purchase of the
interest of his debt, is always fairly paid off; and people there are
so fond of reimbursements, even at this rate of making them, that
when, about the year 1755, a like scheme of paying off those old
annuities was suggested, it was upon condition that every one
having, for instance, an annuity of 100 livres, should, in order to
be intitled to this reimbursement, pay to the King 20 years purchase
of it, or 2000 livres ready money; and that being complied
with, his contract was to be put into the lottery wheel, with all
the rest subscribed for, and if it happened to be drawn, he was to
receive 4000 livres; to wit, the 2000 he had paid down, and the
other 2000 as the value of a capital of 4000 livres, at 2½ <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>This every body must allow procures a wonderful facility in
paying off debts. If the English creditors could be engaged to
enter into the spirit of such reimbursements, government, I am
persuaded, would not apply so closely as they do, to reduce the
interest upon them; whereby a great distress comes upon poor
widows and orphans, who have their all vested in the funds.
This inconvenience is avoided in France: the poor are cherished
by the comfort of high interest; the state is set free; and the
creditors rejoice in getting back their money, in any shape whatever.</p>

<p class='c001'>The war of 1756 breaking out, obliged the King to think of
every expedient to increase his income. Had he set out by borrowing
upon annuities for lives, at 10 <i>per cent.</i> and by mortgaging
his ordinary revenue for the payment of them, his credit would
have been more solid, and the plan of running in debt more
systematical: but in the end, it would have involved him in the
terrible dilemma of either making a bankruptcy, in order to re-instate
himself in the possession of his ordinary revenue, or of
making him depend more than he inclined upon his parliament;
whose authority is absolutely necessary for laying a perpetual
and regular imposition, which alone can form a solid basis of national
credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was therefore resolved, in one way or other, to increase the
impositions on the people in the time of war, in order to avoid the
consequences he foresaw from the loss of his fixed revenue.</p>

<p class='c001'>The King’s ministers at this time could not convince the parliament
of Paris, that in order to borrow money upon the best terms,
it was necessary to have a sure fund for paying the interest of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It had been usual to borrow money, on pressing occasions, from
the farmers of the revenue, bankers, and financiers, as they are
called, at 7 and even 10 <i>per cent.</i> They understanding the chain of
the affairs of France, used to obtain credit both abroad and at
home, from people who would not lend directly to the King; although
they knew at the time of the loan that the money was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>borrowed for his use. The reason was, that the King was under
an absolute necessity to keep faith with this set of men, upon
whom the credit of France has depended for many ages: and as
the profits they used to make were very great, ministers knew, by
a sort of instinct, when they had gained enough; and in clearing
their accounts in the usual way, a sufficiency was left to them, to
repay what they had borrowed from others.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the parliament thought, and perhaps with reason, that
in the main it was cheaper to borrow in this way, at 10 <i>per cent.</i>
than in the English way, at 3 <i>per cent.</i> because of the great facility
in paying off the debts which attended it; but this is only a conjecture.
That there was however a contrast of sentiments between
the parliament, and the minister of the finances at that time,
who had contracted English ideas of credit, is most undoubted;
and it was this contrast which brought on the bankruptcy in 1759,
when the sinking fund was shut up against the creditors by an act
of power. To judge of the sentiments of both parties with candour,
let us then examine the plan of borrowing proposed by the
one, and by the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The minister, M. de Silhouëtte, proposed to the King, to levy, as
a solid fund of credit to borrow upon, a general subvention, as it
was called, over all France; or in other words, to make the repartition
of a large annual payment, over all the cities, towns,
villages, and suburbs in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was to be divided according to the supposed wealth and
quantity of circulation every where. Every district was ordered
to report to the King’s council their opinion concerning the particular
mode of raising their proportional part of it, in the best way
relative to their situation. This report the council was to examine,
and to approve or amend the proposal given in, according to information.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was perhaps the best plan of taxation, if properly executed,
that ever has been thought of, for a nation already under a regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>administration of government, and accustomed to pay considerable
impositions.</p>

<p class='c001'>It removes the inconvenience attending all general taxes, which
never fail to affect unequally different places and districts. It admits
of a prudent mixture of excises, with taxes upon possessions,
according to the internal circumstances of every place. It confines
them to towns, where alone all excises at least can be levied
with propriety. It lightens the oppression of tax-gatherers; because
the corporation may employ whom they will for that purpose. In
a word, it is a tax administred with all the advantages of a farm.</p>

<p class='c001'>This tax, the general subvention, after it had been imposed by
edict, registred in a Bed of justice September 1759, fell to the
ground, from the nature of the French constitution; because it
could not be levied without a systematic administration, supported
by the authority of the courts of law, to which the parliament
would not give their concurrence, for a very plain reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>The general subvention being very extensive, and calculated for
a fund of credit to borrow upon, was, by its nature, of a species
proper to become a perpetual tax, as all excises are. The parliament
of Paris seemed to think it agreeable to the constitution,
which they are sworn to maintain, to preserve at all times in their
hands a certain power over the King’s purse, in order to prevent an
extravagant minister from impoverishing the King and the kingdom
at once, or running them into the inextricable confusion of
an infallible bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c001'>This circumspection of the parliament was represented in another
light at court; and odious parallels were drawn between what
had happened in England about the middle of the last century, and
what soon might be expected in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon such topics every one judges as he is affected. The minister
was railed at by the parliament-party, in the most virulent
manner. Who was in the right, and who was in the wrong, upon
the general question, of the propriety of raising so large an imposition,
to serve as a fund of credit, under a government like that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>of France, I shall not here examine. But that a solid fund should
be provided, in one way or other, proportional to the actual deficiency
of the annual supplies, and to what could not be raised
within the year, for the uses of the war, was, I think, entirely
agreeable to principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>This the minister had proposed in the subvention, though perhaps
the plan was too great; and the parliament, when they rejected
the proposal, sensible that the exigencies of the state demanded
a supply of money, proposed in their turn, as an equivalent
for the general subvention, to coin for 600 millions of notes,
which were to have the sanction of parliament for their fund of
payment; but no provision was made for the ready circulation of
them in the interim.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here then is an example where the sentiments of the French nation
were divided upon the principles of public credit. And this
affords a good opportunity of reconciling them, and of confirming
the doctrine we have been endeavouring to establish.</p>

<p class='c001'>The minister felt the disadvantage of the King’s borrowing upon
a lame security; he therefore proposed a solid and permanent fund
of credit for performing the obligations to be contracted with the
creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'>The parliament, on the other hand, examined the situation of the
people, who, they thought, were no longer in a capacity to pay
the taxes already imposed; and therefore concluded, that it was
unnecessary to establish any new one. They therefore proposed to
augment circulation, by providing a means whereby alienations
might be carried on, and by that they expected to render the taxes
already imposed more productive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both parties were in the right, as commonly is the case in such
disputes; but they did not perceive how their opinions could be
reconciled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had circulation been facilitated by the establishment of a bank
upon true principles, perhaps the taxes already imposed, might
have produced a sufficient fund for carrying on the war, without
the expedient of the general subvention.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>But the manner proposed by the parliament to increase circulation,
by paying with paper money, and not providing a fund for realizing
it when it came to stagnate, was an expedient entirely delusive.
The paper would soon have fallen to a great discount: the remembrance
of the Missisippi would probably have been revived, which
would have occasioned the locking up of the coin; and the kingdom
might have been involved in the greatest distress and bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The minister should therefore have concurred with the parliament
in a scheme for establishing a bank: the King might safely
have entrusted the administration of it to parliament, and even have
supplied coin from the royal treasury for circulating the paper.
But the minister, I suppose, took it for granted, that taxes <em>would</em> be
paid, providing they were imposed; and the parliament, that the
paper <em>would</em> circulate, providing it was issued.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reasonings I have ascribed to each party in this dispute, are not
founded upon information: they are only natural conjectures
which I form from the opposition of sentiments between men who
were all, I suppose, well acquainted with the situation of France,
and who respectively took part according to the combinations which
occurred to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remonstrances of the parliament at that time were filled with
an enumeration of distresses, all of which are the necessary effects of
a scanty circulation. In the King’s edicts there is strong reasoning
upon the principles of public credit. The candour I feel in my
breast, while I examine the merits of this important dispute, will
I hope serve as an apology for all mistakes in point of exact information.</p>

<p class='c001'>The result upon the whole was what might have been expected.
The subvention was dropt, and the proposal of the paper
was rejected by the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>The middle term adopted by the parties, shewed however, I think,
that in the main the minister had been in the right; because the
taxes were increased and paid: had the paper been issued, the success,
I am persuaded, would not have been favourable in proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>But instead of a permanent subvention, a tax of the most odious
nature was established, which, from this very circumstance, there
was little danger of seeing long continued.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the preceeding year, a second twentieth penny upon possessions
had been imposed, to which had been added 2 shillings in the pound
of the tax itself; a new poll-tax upon certain classes of the people
in proportion to the number of their servants; an additional duty
upon the stamps upon silver and gold plate; higher duties on foreign
manufactures imported; and 20 <i>per cent.</i> on all former duties
on consumption. The second twentieth was to continue until two
years after the peace; the other duties for eight years longer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Notwithstanding this heavy load already laid upon property,
the parliament, rather than consent to the subvention, agreed to
impose a third twentieth penny upon possessions; and to render
this tax more productive, additional poll-taxes upon place-men, &amp;c.
were comprehended in that edict. Thus ended the dispute: the
minister was dismissed, and the edict for the general subvention was
withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the second and third twentieth penny, several augmentations
of revenue were obtained during the last war, which I shall
presently mention, two of which, for their peculiarity, I shall briefly
explain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The clergy of France, strongly pressed by the King, supported by
his parliaments, to give in a declaration of their income, in order
to be taxed at so many shillings in the pound, like other subjects,
after many evasions, at last succeeded in disappointing the scheme.
They offered an extraordinary free gift equivalent to the two twentieths,
to be paid annually until 1765, and this was accepted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ordinary free gift of the clergy is at the rate of a million and
a half of livres a year; this they doubled and paid at the rate of
three millions a year, which we may consider as two shillings in
the pound of all the clergy possess in France, which makes their
revenue to be about thirty millions a year, and I believe it does not
far exceed it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>The other branch of revenue is something analogous to a circumstance
in the history of English taxes: it was called an extraordinary
free gift to be paid by every corporation in France. Charles I.
had a very exact valuation put upon all England, when he proposed
to levy ship-money. This was found so correct that it served for a
basis to regulate the distribution of the sum of 100 000<i>l.</i> a year paid
to Charles II. for his courts of wards and liveries<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. Davenant’s Ways and Means, Article of Monthly Assessments.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In like manner the King of France had a very accurate estimate
made of all France, when he formed his edict for a general subvention,
which had pretty much the fate of the ship-money. And
though the parliament refused their consent to the great subvention,
they agreed to establish the epitome of it in August 1759: which
see in the note<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. This free gift was imposed upon all cities, towns, buroughs, villages, and suburbs,
in France. And those lying within the jurisdiction of every Intendant were joined
in one sum, leaving the repartition of them to those magistrates, as the custom is.</p>

<p class='c001'>The duties imposed by this arret are to be levied upon all classes of the people, nobility,
commons, clergy, even nuns and monks; no exception is made except in favour
of hospitals for their own consumption only.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>This tax, small as it is, may be of infinite consequence in times
to come. The great difficulty of raising taxes is in the beginning;
and if the levying of this trifle in every city, town, village, and
suburb, in France, be carefully conducted, with a view to subsequent
augmentations, and if it be properly distributed upon every
branch of consumption and revenue, nothing will be so easy to the
King as, by his own private authority, to enforce a gradual augmentation
of it, and perhaps in time to absorb in it, the whole, or
at least the greatest part of the revenue of his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the two twentieths, and the free gift of the cities, several
other taxes of less moment were either imposed, renewed, or continued
for a longer term, and then sold for raising money for the
service of the year, viz.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Five years of the free gift of the clergy of France, amounting
to 15 millions, were paid down at once by that body.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, That of the clergy of Alsace, paid in the same way, for the
same term, produced 3 millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, A duty on firewood, &amp;c. in the city of Paris, valued at
3 400 000 a year, sold for 7 years, for 10 millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, Another duty upon the consumption of eggs, butter, &amp;c. valued
at 2 400 000, sold for 15 years for above 30 millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>5<i>to</i>, A like sum got from the farmers general, for allowing them
to raise the price of their tobacco 10 <i>per cent.</i> for 10 years. The
annual amount of this I do not know.</p>

<p class='c001'>6<i>to</i>, And in the last place, the third twentieth penny, which produced
36 270 000 a year, was sold for the two years for which it
was imposed, for 60 millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, of all the impositions raised during the last war, the second
twentieth, and an epitome of the subvention raised in all cities,
towns, villages, and suburbs, in France, remain unalienated.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to throw all the light I possibly can upon the present
state of that nation, I shall next briefly recapitulate the extent of
the annual supplies raised for the service of the different years of
the war, from 1756 to 1762 inclusive; in which I shall point out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>as well as I can, how this third branch of revenue was appropriated.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in this manner only I can communicate to the reader what I
can guess concerning the present state of that nation. Could we
know, as with us, the amount of taxes, and outstanding debts at
every period, that detail would be unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>The extraordinary grants of 1756, amounted to 121 millions,
5 377 777<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>In October 1755, the farms of almost all the taxes were renewed.
Upon such occasions, it is usual for the farmers to advance sums
in proportion to the extent of their farms, for security of the lease;
for which advances the King, at that time, allowed them an interest
out of their yearly farm-rent of 5 <i>per cent.</i> and the sums advanced
were appropriated for the service of the year 1756. Here follow
the sums advanced upon the several farms.</p>

stood at their full extent, without diminution, at the peace,

revenue, the amount of new taxes imposed, or such branches of

<p class='c001'>Formerly, all the officers of the courts of justice had salaries paid
out of the King’s revenue. These were insensibly diminished in
every reign, and those court-fees were augmented in order to fill
up the void; from which the greatest oppression ensues.</p>

<p class='c001'>If to the sum in this last article we add 22 millions above stated
as a charge upon the ordinary revenue for salaries to first presidents,
&amp;c. and other expences of the law, we shall find that the article
of justice alone costs near 50 millions of livres, a year, to the
public. The greatest part of this sum should be considered as the
interest of money borrowed by the Kings of France, the capitals
whereof are still outstanding; and if the capitals were paid off, a
great augmentation of income would arise from it. But the bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>footing upon which their credit stands, renders even this burden
expedient on some occasions; because the King can oblige all those
who have such hereditary offices, to lend money upon an augmentation
of their salaries.</p>

of France, we must not omit the last branch, which comprehends

<p class='c001'>In this light does the state of the French affairs appear, from the
sketch I have been able to give of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had the sum of 86 millions, remaining as unappropriated at the
peace, been any way sufficient for paying off claims which have not
appeared upon the state we have given, and for all extraordinary
expences, the credit of France would not have been so low as it then
was, and still continues to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>The expence of a kingdom must constantly exceed the amount of
all regular and permanent income.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the end of a war what great sums of debts unprovided for are
constantly found! Taxes also, when stretched as they were, and
imposed in so great a proportion upon possessions, in respect of
what was raised upon consumption, must always diminish in their
produce; but the expence and charges never fall short. This is
more especially the case in a country where paper credit is not established.</p>

<p class='c001'>The constant complaints for want of money to carry on circulation
in the time of war, is a proof of it. When peace returns, and
money is kept at home, then all taxes are readily paid in France,
and half the burden of them is not felt, although they be more
productive than before.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I said in setting out, I do not pretend that the account I have
given of this dark affair, is in any degree so correct as to satisfy a
French minister; but it is a rough sketch, which contains the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>state of their affairs; and if it be worth any man’s while, who
is better informed, he may correct it, and thereby bring on a farther
inquiry into the true state of the question.</p>

<p class='c001'>What interest a nation, which is not in an actual state of bankruptcy,
can have in concealing its affairs, I cannot find out. How
much more then is it not the interest of a mighty kingdom, which
possesses such amazing resources, to expose its situation in a fair
light to the world, to which it must, upon all occasions, have recourse
for assistance in point of credit?</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the many branches which compose this great national revenue
of above 550 millions, there are several articles which must of necessity
be cut off, so soon as the debts are brought into a regular
form. The double poll-tax is most oppressive on the poorer sort,
and therefore was imposed only for a time: the three twentieths,
as they are levied, are no less so upon the higher classes of the
people.</p>

<p class='c001'>These four articles amount, however, to 116 millions. If we
deduct this from the revenue, as we have stated the account of it,
it will not only exhaust the balance of 86 millions, but it will create
a deficiency, upon the whole, of 30 millions, which can only be
compensated by discharging a corresponding part of the burden of
debts, while those branches do subsist.</p>

<p class='c001'>But then the same resources are open upon every new emergency;
and as they have now begun to be collected, they will be
more easily paid at another time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, what an acquisition will be made to the revenue by the
extinction of 16 millions of life-annuities, and by the expiration of
so many anticipations of taxes for terms of years!</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, it is not to be supposed that the King will
continue to demand of the clergy, above 1 500 000 livres a year, or
one shilling in the pound upon their benefices. That body is becoming
daily more and more indebted, by the practice introduced
of late, of making payment of their free gifts to the King, by borrowing
the money, instead of paying every one’s proportion out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>his benefice. This in time may oblige them to accept of pensions
for their benefices, and to make over their revenue in tithes to the
King: they will, at least, in one way or other, become entirely at
his mercy, and at that of their own creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before I conclude, I must say a word concerning the method of
levying the taxes in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most general distribution I can make of this, is to reduce it
under four principal heads.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first comprehends the general <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>receptes</i></span>; to wit, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>, or
land-tax, the <em>capitation</em>, or poll-tax, and all the twentieths. These
are administred by the intendants of the provinces, who both
make the distribution of them upon the subjects, and who levy
them by officers under their direction; and for the expence of levying,
is superadded to the taxes, 10 <i>per cent.</i> upon the whole. When
they are collected, they are paid in to the receivers general at Paris,
who deliver them in, and account for them to the royal treasury.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second comprehends all the taxes which are farmed. The
farmers are vested with the King’s authority for raising the duties
let to them, according to certain regulations; and as they are obliged
to keep open books, the expence of management is known, and at
every new lease a reasonable profit is allowed to them over and above.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third branch comprehends all free gifts of determinate sums
of money, imposed according to certain regulations prescribed to
those bodies politic who pay them; into which may be comprehended
all taxes upon the clergy; because they levy them themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth comprehends retentions which the King makes out
of the salaries he pays. This needs no explanation.</p>

<p class='c001'>What farther observations may be made on this head will find a
place when we speak of taxes.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.4.7' class='c015'>CHAP. VII.<br /> <i>Comparative View of the Revenue, Debts, and Credit of Great Britain and France.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In comparing the state of credit in the two nations, I must first
observe, that it is not so essential to compare the <em>extent of the
revenue</em> of both countries, as the <em>resources</em> they have for obtaining
extraordinary supplies in case of need.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever be the permanent revenue of a state, we may be very
certain that the exigencies of it will be in proportion; and whenever
any extraordinary expence is to be incurred, it must be provided
for by extraordinary means.</p>

<p class='c001'>In examining the state of Great Britain and France, we have
found this observation verified. If the expences of the year do no
more than absorb the revenue of it, and if the sinking funds appropriated
for paying off incumbrances be properly applied, the
state has no reason to complain.</p>

<p class='c001'>This distribution evidently points out how necessary it is not to
confound those branches of revenue which are appropriated to
state expences, with those which ought to be set apart for the payment
of debts and interest. This however I apprehend is too
much neglected in both kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c001'>If times of tranquillity be not made use of, to disengage those
funds which necessity had opened, it cannot be denied, that future
exigencies must then seek for a supply, from resources as
yet undiscovered.</p>

<p class='c001'>That nation, therefore, which has certain branches of revenue
lying dormant in time of peace, has the advantage in point of resources.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>In this respect the advantage hitherto has lain on the side of
France; she has had her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dixiemes</i></span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>vingtiemes</i></span>, and double poll-tax,
which have never been imposed except in cases of necessity.</p>

<p class='c001'>But on the other hand, Great Britain has a noble and opulent
branch of permanent taxes, which composes her sinking fund.
Were this employed in times of peace, as it ought to be, it would
prove in time of war a more ready fund of credit than any France
can boast of.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those extraordinary resources of France cannot be mortgaged.
They are supplies for the current service; but they are no fund of
credit. Whereas the sinking fund of Great Britain is always ready
in the mean time to supply urgent demands. While this subsists,
there is no danger of being obliged to break faith with all the public
creditors, upon a demand for a million and a half sterling, as was
the case with France in 1759. The one resembles a credit in bank;
the other the rents of a great estate. The sinking fund affords time
to raise new supplies, in proportion to the debts contracted; and
if these, when new, and raised in time of war, prove sufficient to
answer the interest of the loan, they will probably do more as they
continue to be levied, and upon the return of peace.</p>

<p class='c001'>One very remarkable difference between the state of credit in
the two nations is, that in Britain the object of attention is the
rate of interest; in France it is the speedy repayment of the capital.
The great care of a British minister is to support the price of
the funds: the meaning of which is, to keep the interest of money
low. Did not the price of the funds regulate the rate of money,
the state would be nowise concerned in the price of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the credit of Great Britain is so firmly established, that she
may command money at all times, providing she will give the interest
required.</p>

<p class='c001'>The case is totally different in France. Her credit is not well
established; that terrible Missisippi-monument, of near a thousand
millions, standing fixed upon the ordinary revenue to this day at
2½ <i>per cent.</i> first reduced from the most exorbitant interest, by successive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>acts of power, after the late King’s death, and afterwards
from a moderate interest to 2½ <i>per cent.</i> in the year 1720, is reason
sufficient to deter monied men from lending to France upon perpetual
interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>In borrowing upon life-annuities at 10 <i>per cent.</i> and upon lotteries
at nearly the same rate, for 11 or 12 years, France obtains credit
for large sums. She also borrows with tolerable success at 5 <i>per
cent.</i> when there is a lottery-clause put in, which stipulates a large
sum to be annually paid for extinguishing the capital. The reason
is, she is more punctual to such engagements: they remain constantly
under the eye of the public: the stock-holders consider their
money as constantly coming in; and any interruption in the payment
gives a general alarm. But when funds are settled at perpetual
interest, people lose sight of the capital altogether. The
contracts by which they are commonly constituted, are not so easily
transferred as other funds: in a word, it is not the taste of the
French nation to lend their money in that way, and far less the
taste of strangers; and the reason is, that as matters have hitherto
been conducted, it has by no means been their interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the commencement of the late war, no security in France
was looked upon as better than the actions of the company of the
Indies. This was a fund of perpetual interest. They brought in
to purchasers little more than 4 <i>per cent.</i> and every body wished to
have them. Every action bore a dividend of eighty livres a year;
and the action itself sold from eighteen to nineteen hundred livres.
The war had not lasted four years, when the dividends were reduced
to one half, and the capital fell to about 700.</p>

<p class='c001'>In short, all perpetual funds in France, whether upon government
or company-security, are very precarious; and while this is
the case, we may decide that the credit they are built on is precarious
also.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.4.8' class='c015'>CHAP. VIII.<br /> <i>Contingent Consequences of the Extension of Credit, and Increase of Debts.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Having applied the principles of public credit to the state
of facts in Great Britain and France, such as I have been
able to collect, I must observe, that all short sketches of this kind are
intended only to satisfy a general curiosity which mankind has,
to know a little of every thing. Although they may appear superficial
and incorrect, to persons thoroughly instructed in those matters,
they still are for our purpose; which is only to take them as
something approaching nearer to truth than bare suppositions can
do; and they sufficiently answer the purpose of illustrating the
subject we are upon.</p>

<p class='c001'>I now proceed to inquire what may be the consequences of this
mighty change produced upon the policy of industrious and
trading states, from the establishment of credit, debts, and taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have, from the very beginning of this inquiry, occasionally
taken notice of the influence that such a change must make upon
the spirit and manners of a people. The lower classes, who are
slow in forming combinations, do not soon comprehend the necessary
consequences of such revolutions. Even ministers have been
often at a loss to judge of the consequences which might follow
upon some steps of their own conduct relative thereto, although
taken upon mature deliberation.</p>

<p class='c001'>When public credit is employed for raising money upon a plan
of refunding the capital, either by uniform annual payments exceeding
the interest, or by funds established for sinking the capital,
no contingent consequences can happen, providing the plan be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>executed: the debts contracted will be paid, and matters will return
to their former state.</p>

<p class='c001'>When public credit is employed for raising money upon payment
of a perpetual interest; or if, whatever be the plan laid down,
capitals should not happen to be discharged, and that the debts
should swell continually; in this case, the contingent consequences
are many and various, far exceeding any man’s sagacity to investigate.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we judge of them from what past experience teaches us, we
may conclude, that, in one way or other, all debts contracted will
in time disappear, either by being paid, or by being abolished:
because it is not to be expected that posterity will groan under
such a load any longer than it is convenient; and because in fact
we see no very old public debts as yet outstanding, where interest
has been regularly paid.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a very rational conclusion from past experience; but it is
only relative to the circumstances of past times. While the debtors
are the masters, there is no difficulty of getting clear of debts: but
if the consequence of this new system should be to make the creditors
the masters, I suppose the case might be different. Farther,</p>

<p class='c001'>In former times public debts were contracted between the state
and its own subjects; but at present we see that in such loans, foreigners,
even enemies, are invited to concur: and the better to
engage them to it, a total immunity is promised from all taxes
upon the interest to be paid by the borrowers.</p>

<p class='c001'>This circumstance has already drawn the attention of Princes, in
the discussion of their reciprocal concerns. We saw how, in the
treaty of Dresden, which took place after the King of Prussia’s invasion
of Saxony in 1745, it was provided by the 6th article,
that all debts due by the bank of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Steuer</i></span> to that Prince’s subjects,
were to be paid, on presentation of their contracts.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have not indeed as yet seen wars carried on for the payment
of debts; but the case may happen, and kingdoms may be carried
off upon such pretensions, as well as private property. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>a chain of contingent consequences arises from this single combination,
were this a proper place to introduce them!</p>

<p class='c001'>But without going to the supposition of Princes or nations becoming
reciprocally engaged in debts, and thereby involving such
mighty interests in the support of public faith, we may easily conceive,
that a monied interest, of a long standing, may have influence
enough to operate a change upon the spirit and manners of a
people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me here take the example of Great Britain. Do we not see
how the spirit of that nation is totally bent upon the support of
public credit? And do we not see how absolutely their commercial
interest depends upon it? Can it be supposed, that every one has
combined all the consequences which may flow from the constant
swelling of their debts? Or indeed is it possible to determine what
will be the consequences of them? This however we may suppose
at least, because we see the progress of it already, that the interest
of the creditors will daily gather strength, both in parliament and
without: and if from small beginnings it has arrived at the pitch
we now see, it is very natural to conclude, that, in time, it may
become stronger, and at last, that the creditors of the nation may
become the masters of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When any one interest becomes too predominant, the prosperity
of the state stands upon a precarious footing. Every interest should
be encouraged, protected, and kept within due bounds. The following
speculations are intended for the application of principles
to new and unexperienced combinations; where natural causes
<em>may</em> work their direct and immediate effects, and thereby prove
prejudicial to the general welfare, unless they be foreseen in some
degree, and proper remedies be prepared against them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Europe was possessed by our ancestors free from taxes; our fathers
saw them imposed, and we see how fast they become mortgaged
for our debts. We can as little judge of the extent of our
credit, as they could of the possibility of contributing so large a
fund for the support of it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>As the plan of imposing taxes has been extended, we see the
public coffers every day receiving a vast flux of money, and like
the heart in the human body, throwing it out again into circulation.
Happy state, could it be lasting, and were this flux and reflux
preserved in a due proportion to all the uses for which it is intended!
But states have their vices, as well as private people.
Public opulence should be proportioned to public exigencies: but
how often do we see ambition putting on the face of public spirit,
and animating the resentment of a nation, under colour of providing
for her security? Hence wars, from wars expence: recourse
is had to credit, money is borrowed, debts are contracted, taxes are
augmented; all this increases circulation, which demands a supply
of currency: this is procured by melting down the solid property.
These operations performed, the public money is either
sent abroad, or remains at home. If sent abroad, more property
must be melted down, in order to fill up the void. If it remains at
home, it will animate every branch of circulation; and when the
exigency, which required this additional quantity of money, is
over, what circulation finds superfluous, will stagnate in the hands
of the monied interest, and will either form a new fund for contracting
more debts, or it will be laid out in the purchase of the
property formerly melted down, which produced it; and thereby
will be consolidated a-new.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every interest in a state must influence the government of it, in
proportion to its consequence and weight; and every government
must influence the spirit of the people who live under it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, as we have seen how industry creates wealth; how wealth
and confidence create credit; how credit creates debts and taxes;
how these again occasion an augmentation of money, by the melting
down of property; and how this property is transferred to a
new set of men, who were once the monied interest, and who
afterwards acquire the lands, and consolidate this additional circulation;
does not this chain of consequences represent a kind of
circle, returning into itself? And is it not plain, that without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>the intervention of this engine, the money created in proportion
to the demand for it, the chain would be cut off, before it could
reach the link from which it first set out? Will not this conversion
of a monied interest into a landed interest, insensibly inspire the
bulk of the landlords with sentiments analogous to a monied interest?
Is not that evidently more and more the case every day in
England? And from this may we not prognosticate the solidity of
public credit in that nation?</p>

<p class='c001'>If on the other hand we find, as in France, industry in times of
peace drawing wealth from other nations, and thereby increasing
the coin, upon which alone credit is circulated through the kingdom;
and then foreign expence sending it away in times of war;
must not circulation keep pace with the coin, that is to say, be
circumscribed within the proportion of it?</p>

<p class='c001'>If the solidity and extent of the French King’s free revenue
should afford credit to borrow this coin; and if, instead of providing
a proportional supply of currency to fill up this new loan,
the coin borrowed be sent out of France; how will the ordinary
circulation be carried on?</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us here recal to mind what was said in the 22d chapter, upon
banks, where we distinguished voluntary circulation, which is buying,
from <em>involuntary</em> circulation, which is paying: we there observed
how <em>paying</em> must always take place of <em>buying</em>; consequently,
we may here determine that taxes must be paid before buying, that
is consumption, can go on. The deficiency therefore of coin for
circulation, will, first, proportionally affect the trade, manufactures,
and consumption of France, and afterwards the revenue
which arises from them. Is not this the constant complaint in
France, when war carries off their coin? The remonstrances of
all their parliaments are filled with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In times of peace, the amount of what comes from the people is
greater than in time of war: but then there is coin sufficient for
all the payments; and when they are made to the royal treasury,
they immediately return into circulation, and no hurt is felt.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>I insist the more upon this principle, and I introduce it in so
many different ways, and under such a variety of views, because
I take it to be one of the most important considerations in the
whole doctrine of credit, and one which I have never seen suggested
by any French, or English writer upon this subject. Many
are the complaints for want of money; but no method have I ever
seen proposed for obtaining it from solid property; the easiest
and safest of all operations, when conducted with honesty, and
according to principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>As money therefore is the means of closing the chain of consequences
already mentioned, and forming it into a circle, as has
been said, we plainly see how, when it is wanting, the same effects
cannot be produced; and consequently the country of France,
when money is confined to the coin, will be very long in adopting
the sentiments of a monied interest; whether for its profit or loss,
in the end, is not here the question.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have now traced the contingent consequences of public credit
so far as to shew how it <em>may</em> tend to influence the spirit of a
people, and make them adopt the sentiments of a monied interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The allurement of acquiring land-property is very great, no
doubt, especially to monied men. The ease and affluence of those,
on the other hand, who have their capitals in their pocket-books,
is very attracting to the eyes of many landlords, especially at
a time when they are paying the heavy taxes laid upon their possessions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The firm establishment of public credit tends greatly to introduce
those reciprocal sentiments of good-will among the two great
classes of a people, and thereby preserves a balance between them.
The monied interest wish to promote the prosperity of the landlords;
the landlords, the solidity of credit; and the well-being of
both depends upon the success of trade and industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now suppose what is actually the case in Great Britain,
that from the swelling of public debts an enormous fund of property
is created. This is formed out of the income of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>nation; and as it has been purchased by those who have lent money
to the state, in common language it is included in what we
call the monied interest: it is however very distinct from it, as
will be understood from what is to follow.</p>

<p class='c001'>The capital of the public debts is the price which was paid for
the annuities due to the creditors, and is now no more money to
them than land is money to the landlord. It may be turned into
money, no doubt; but so may land.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the monied interest, properly, should be understood, those
who have money, not realized upon any fund, and who either
employ it in the way of trade, in the way of industry, in jobbing
in land, in stock, or in any way they please, so as to draw from it
an annual income. While it is fixed, that is, given for any permanent
value, it ceases to be money; when it is called in, it becomes
money again. Let stock, therefore, suffer ever so many
alienations from hand to hand, it still continues stock: it never can
become land, it never can become money, until it be paid off. I
hope this idea is clear, and understood. Stock, therefore, I here
consider as one great branch of solid property; so far as the
security of government is solid and good; and as such, may be
melted down into money by banks, as well as any other thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now I have said that this fund is formed out of the income of the
whole nation; consequently by <em>fund</em>, here, I do not understand the
capital, which exists no more, but the interest which is drawn for
it: it is this interest, I say, which arises from the land, money,
trade, industry, &amp;c. From the land, out of the amount of the
taxes charged upon it; from the money, trade, industry, &amp;c. out
of the amount of proportional taxes, such as excises, customs, salt-tax,
stamp-duties, and the like.</p>

<p class='c001'>The more the debts increase, by the monied interest realizing
into this branch of solid property, the more the taxes must augment;
and consequently, the more the solid property of the funds
themselves will be affected, as well as the land.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>From this exposition of the matter, I think it appears pretty evident,
that as proportional taxes affect every man’s income, according
to his consumption; the landlord, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cæteris paribus</i></span>, who pays a
land tax, as well as his proportion upon his consumption, is more
hardly dealt with than the proprietor of the other branch of solid
property, the funds, who only pays the proportion of the last.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the condition of the stockholder is not equal to that of the
landlord, for two very plain reasons. The first is, that the income
of his stock cannot increase; that of the land may. The second
is, that the swelling of this great capital of stock has the effect of
sinking the interest upon it, and consequently of diminishing the
income of the stockholder; and in proportion to that diminution,
the value of land is augmented. Now I readily allow that the augmentation
upon the <em>value</em> of lands is no inducement to a landlord
to turn them into money; because he would then lose upon his
money, what he gains upon the additional price received. But it
is a great advantage in this respect, that he thereby diminishes
the interest he pays upon his debts, if he has any; and if he has
none, it enables him to borrow at a lower rate for the future; and
by improving his lands with the money borrowed, he augments
his income much beyond the proportion of the interest paid.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is therefore necessary, in imposing land taxes, rightly to combine
every circumstance; that the load of all impositions may be
equally distributed upon every class of a people who enjoy superfluity,
and upon no other. If, after a fair deduction of principles,
this shall appear a thing possible to be done, we may expect to see
statesmen engaged to depart from the old maxim of grasping at
what is readiest and nearest at hand, to wit, the landed property,
with a view to spare a class of people, which, in a well regulated
state, never can be made to feel the burden of any proportional
tax whatsoever; I mean the industrious poor.</p>

<p class='c001'>I now proceed in my inquiry into the nature and consequences of
the swelling of this great branch of property, the public funds.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>As to the nature of it, we have said already, that it is formed by
realizing money into stock. When government borrows, the lenders
must be people who have money. If the loan is made at home,
the money is no sooner paid in, than it is spent; and as we may
suppose that it would not have been lent, had either the lenders
found it necessary for their current expence, or had they found a
more profitable way of realizing it than by lending it to government,
we consider it as in a state of stagnation; but being lent to
government, it is thrown into a new channel of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther, this money stagnating in the hands of the lender, either
proceeded from his income, which exceeded his expence, or from
the profits of his industry. In either case, the country is neither
poorer or richer, when considered in a cumulative view, than if the
same sum had been lent to private people at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next suppose the money to have been borrowed for the
exigence of a foreign war. In this case, if it be borrowed at home
and sent abroad, it must first be converted into the money of the
world, gold and silver, and then sent off, to the diminution of this
kind of property; or it must go abroad in the money of the country,
credit, to the diminution of the annual income upon which
the credit is established. As this last operation may not be so clear,
an example will explain it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Government borrows a million; it is paid in paper, and must be
sent to Holland. If at that time a balance be due by Holland for a
million, bills will readily be found for it. In this case, the balance
of trade is borrowed by government, and is converted into a capital
of a million in the public funds, the interest of which will remain
at home, and continue to be the property of the nation. But
as the value of this balance is sent to Holland and spent abroad, it
is, upon the whole, to the nation, as if the balance had not been
due to them. This I call a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lucrum cessans</i></span> to the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>But suppose no balance due at the time the million comes to be
sent off, I say the consequence will be, to alienate in favour of foreigners
a part of the annual income, proportional to the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>interest paid for the loan, whether it has been subscribed for by
foreigners, or by natives.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the subscription comes from foreigners, the consequence is
evident: it is equally so in the other case, upon a little reflection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose then the million subscribed for, and paid in London.
Bills are sought for; none are found, I mean in the way of reciprocal
compensation, does not this sum immediately become a balance
against London? And as a country loses all such balances, and
that the country to which they are due gains them, this million is
lost to England, and forms what I call a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>damnum emergens</i></span>; that is to
say, her former property or income is so far diminished, or comes
to be transferred to strangers.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we may conclude, that in all matters of public borrowing,
it is of no consequence whether the subscription be filled by
natives, or by foreigners, when the value of it is to be sent abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine the state of the question when the loan is
made in order to be spent at home, as is the case after a war, when
the unfunded debts come to be paid off.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said that loans are filled by money stagnating, which the
owner desires to realize: if he cannot do better, he lends it to government;
if he can do better, he will not lend it.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the uses of domestic circulation absorb all the money in the
country, that is to say, when there are private persons ready to borrow
all the money to be lent, at this time government cannot borrow
at home; and if they did, by offering a high interest for it, the
borrowing would do harm to circulation; because it would raise interest
at home, or disappoint those who would gladly borrow it, for
little more than the interest offered by government.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next suppose that after a war, when the unfunded debts
are either bearing a high interest, or selling at discount, government
shall find an advantage in opening a subscription, which may
be filled from abroad, at a lower rate than the then actual value of
money. Suppose, I say, the Dutch should be willing to lend at
3 <i>per cent.</i> while money in England stood at 4 <i>per cent.</i> I ask if, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>this case, government ought to borrow from Holland, at the expence
of sending the interest out of the country, rather than suffer such
debts to sell at discount; or to continue paying a higher interest at
home for what they owe?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is my opinion that still they ought to borrow, for the following
reasons. That if the high interest at home proceeds from want of
money, that is to say, from circulation not being full enough, it is
their interest to borrow, were it for nothing else than to supply
circulation; because unless this be full, all industry must languish.
But suppose it should be said that circulation is full enough, that
industry suffers no check from that quarter, but that there being
no superfluity of money, interest stands 1 <i>per cent.</i> higher than it
would do were there considerable stagnations. In that case also, I
think it is their interest to borrow, were it for no other reason than
to produce such stagnations.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a general rule every where, that there is no having enough
without having a superfluity; at least there is no certainty of one’s
having enough without finding a superfluity. Borrowing, therefore,
in small sums, at such a time, will produce stagnations at
home, from which succeeding loans may be filled, after circulation
is sufficiently provided: and even in case more should be borrowed
from strangers than is necessary, and that in consequence of it, too
much should come to stagnate at home, after the demand of government
is over, in that case, the monied interest would lend, in
their turn, to other states, where interest is higher; and the annual
returns from that quarter would more than compensate what must
be sent away, in consequence of the former borrowing.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these combinations, let us draw some conclusions.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, That the effect of public borrowing, or national debt, is to
augment the permanent income of the country, out of stagnating
money, and balances of trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, That this income so created, may be either the property of
natives, or of strangers.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>3<i>tio</i>, That when money is found to stagnate, in a country where
circulation is not diminishing, it may be supposed to proceed from
the coming in of a right balance of trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, If stagnations in one part are found to interrupt circulation
in another, public borrowing, for domestic purposes, has the good
effect of giving vent to the stagnation, and throwing the money into
a new channel of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>5<i>to</i>, That the sum of interest paid by any nation to strangers,
shews the general balance due by the nation, after deducting all
the profits of their past trade out of all the expence of their foreign
wars.</p>

<p class='c001'>But here it must be observed, that as on one hand we are comprehending
all that is paid to foreign creditors, on account of the funds
they have in England, for example, so on the other hand, must be
deducted from this, all the like payments made to Englishmen by
other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>6<i>to</i>, From this last circumstance we discover, that the lending to
other nations by private hands, produces the same effect to a nation
as if the state were actually paying off the debts due to strangers.
Consequently, when Moses permitted the Jews to lend to strangers
at interest, and forbade such loans among themselves, his view was
to establish a foreign tribute, as it were, in favour of his own nation,
instead of establishing luxury at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>7<i>mo</i>, As the balance due to a nation upon her trade, is found to
compensate, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro tanto</i></span>, the money she spends abroad, we may from
the same principle conclude, that so soon as she ceases to expend
money abroad, the balance of trade in her favour, if not realized
at home in some new improvement, will diminish, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro tanto</i></span>, the
interest, or capitals due to strangers. This is evident from the nature
of balances, of which we have treated already.</p>

<p class='c001'>8<i>vo</i>, The consequence, for example, of England’s owing large
sums to strangers, will, from the same principle, constantly prevent
exchange from rising very high in her favour, when the balance
of her trade is to be paid to her: because on every such occasion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>her foreign creditors will be glad to disappoint exchangers, by furnishing
bills for their interest, or capitals, to those who owe the balance;
the consequence of which is plainly to diminish the foreign
debts<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. We must always carefully avoid confounding the grand balance of payments with
the balance between importation and exportation, which I consider as the balance of
trade.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This circumstance implies no loss to the nation which is creditor
in the balance of trade, and debtor upon the capitals; because we
have proved that the price of exchange never affects a nation, but
only certain individuals, who pay it to others.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is sufficient, I think, to point out in some degree the nature
of a national debt. I come next to examine the consequences of its
constant augmentation, without proper measures being taken,
either to pay it off, or to circumscribe it within certain bounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>In what is to follow, I shall throw all consideration of capitals totally
out of the question; and as to the amount of taxes, it is quite
indifferent whether the money proceeding from them be in consequence
of an improvement made upon those already established, or
from new impositions: such combinations will come in more properly
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the interest paid upon the national debt of England, for example,
be found constantly to increase upon every new war, the
consequence will be, that more money will be raised on the subject
for the payment of it. The question then comes to be, 1. How
far may debts extend? 2. How far may taxes be carried? And 3.
What will be the consequence, supposing the one and the other carried
to the greatest height possible?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer to the first, that abstracting from circumstances which
may disturb the gradual progress of this operation, before it can
arrive at the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne plus ultra</i></span>, debts may be increased to the full proportion
of all that can be raised for the payment of the interest. As to
the second, How far taxes may be carried, I shall not here anticipate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>the subject of the following book, any farther than is necessary to
resolve the question before us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes, we have said, either affect income, or consumption. The
land-tax of England is now at 4 shillings in the pound, upon a supposed
value of the property affected by it, which is all real and personal
estates, the stock upon lands, and some few other particulars
excepted.</p>

<p class='c001'>This tax may be carried to the full value of all the real estates
in England. As for personal estates it never can affect them proportionally;
and that part of the statute of land-tax which passes every
year, and imposes 4 shillings in the pound on personal estates, carries
in it a vestige of our former ignorance in matters ©f taxation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The notion of imposing (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>facto</i></span>) 20 shillings in the pound upon the
real value of all the land-rents of England, appears to us perfectly
ridiculous. I admit it to be so; and could I have discovered any
argument, by which I could have limited the rising of the land-tax
to any precise number of shillings under twenty, I should have
stated this as the maximum, rather than the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second branch of taxes comprehends those upon consumptions,
excises, and the like. The maximum as to this class must
be determined by foreign trade; because this is affected in a certain
degree by the price of domestic industry. Other taxes have not
this effect, as we shall shew in its proper place.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as foreign trade is not essential to the domestic industry, consumption,
circulation, &amp;c. of any nation, as has been proved in
the second book, but only to their increasing in wealth proportionally
to other nations; if foreign communications should be cut
off entirely, I perceive no limit to which I can confine the extent of
proportional taxes. Let me therefore suppose a term beyond which
impositions of all kinds must come to a stop, and then ask, in the
third place, what will the consequence be? I answer, that the state
will then be in possession of all that can be raised on the land, on
the consumption, industry and trade of the country; in short, of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>that can be called income, which they will administer for the creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'>When this comes to be the case, debts become extinguished of
course; because they come to be consolidated with the property: a
case which commonly happens when a creditor takes possession of
an estate for the payment of debts equal to its value.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then government may continue to administer for the creditors,
and either retain in its hand what is necessary for the public expence
of the year; or if it inclines to shew the same indulgence for this new
class of proprietors as for the former, it may limit the retention to
a sum only equal to the interest of the money wanted; and in that
way set out upon a new system of borrowing, until the amount of
taxes be transferred to a new set of creditors. This is the endless
path referred to in the ninth chapter of the second book, which after
a multitude of windings returns into itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>A state, I imagine, which would preserve its public faith inviolable,
until a period such as I have been supposing, would run
little risk of not finding credit for a new borrowing. The prospect
of a second revolution of the same kind would be very distant; and
in matters of credit, which are constantly exposed to risk, such
events being out of the reach of calculation, are never taken into
any man’s account who has money to lend.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole of this hypothesis is, I readily agree, destitute of all
probability; because of the infinite variety of circumstances which
may frustrate such a scheme. I only introduced it to shew where
the constant mortgaging of a public revenue may end; and to disprove
the vulgar notion, that by contracting debts beyond a certain
sum, <em>a trading nation which has a great balance in its favour</em>, must be involved
in an unavoidable bankruptcy. To say that a <em>nation</em> must
become bankrupt to itself, is a proposition which I think implies a
contradiction.</p>

  <h4 id='ch4.4.9' class='c015'>CHAP. IX.<br /><i>Of Bankruptcies.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In the last chapter we have been running through a chain of consequences
relative to the increase of public debts, which appear
as extravagant to us at present, as it would have appeared to Davenant,
to have supposed the debts of this nation to grow up to their
present height, without the risk of involving the nation in a general
bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c001'>But those consequences are only contingent. The present debts
may either be paid off, or the nation may be involved in a general
bankruptcy. In either case, the vast property in the funds, this
great article of permanent income, belonging to natives and to foreigners,
must wither and decay, and at last disappear altogether.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may therefore decide, that one of three events must happen,
viz. either, 1. Debts will swell to such a pitch as at last to pay
themselves: or, 2. The nation will be involved in a bankruptcy:
or, 3. They will be fairly paid off.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first supposition we have examined; the second we are now
to consider; the last will be the subject of the following chapter,
with which I shall conclude this book.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall advance no argument to prove that the scheme of a public
bankruptcy is either lawful, honourable, or expedient, if voluntarily
gone into by a state; because I think it is diametrically opposite
to every principle of good government. It is a maxim uncontroverted,
that a contract is binding between the parties contracting,
and that it ought to be fulfilled in every article. If the public good
be alleged as an overruling principle, to which every other must
give way, I readily admit the exception. There is another of equal
force, the impossibility of performance. When such arguments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>are used to engage a nation to commit a deliberate act of bankruptcy,
two things must be examined: the first, is the interest which
the public has in adopting the scheme: the second, the consequences
of it. What reasons a state may have, I shall consider afterwards;
at present, I shall enquire what might be the consequences
of a general and total bankruptcy in England; from which we may
gather what difference it would make, were it only partial; and
by such an inquiry, we may be led to discover the proper method
of breaking faith, in case it should become unavoidable. This is
what in another place I called bringing credit decently to her grave;
when after being overstretched, it cannot longer be supported.</p>

<p class='c001'>A bankruptcy may take place in two ways: either as a consequence
of circumstances which cannot be prevented; or by a deliberate
act of government.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were the trade and industry of England to decay, the amount of
taxes might so far diminish, as to prove insufficient to pay the interest
of the national debt, and defray the expence of government.
Were the people to be blown up into a spirit of revolt against taxes,
the same event would probably happen. In either case, the natural
and immediate consequences of the bankruptcy would probably
follow one another in this manner:</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Every creditor of the state would become poorer in proportion
to the diminution of his income.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, Consumption and the demand for work would diminish in
proportion to the part of that income withheld, which the creditors
annually expend for these purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, Trade would <em>directly</em> suffer, in proportion to that part of the
said revenue yearly thrown into it by the public creditors at present;
and it would <em>consequently</em> suffer, in proportion to the hurt resulting
to private credit, from the consequences of the bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The creditors then would lose all, the trade of England would be
undone, and the multitudes who live in consequence of the demand
for their industry from the one and the other, would be reduced to
misery. These immediate effects would first manifest themselves in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>the capital. The consequences would soon be felt all over England:
a diminution upon the consumption of the fruits of the
earth; a stagnation of that commerce which is carried on between
London and the country (which we have seen to be equal to the
amount of all the taxes and land-rents spent in London) would soon
throw every thing into confusion. But taxes would be abolished: of
that there is no doubt. Let a deliberate bankruptcy take place without
any abolition of them by law, they would soon sink to nothing,
from the utter impossibility there would be found to pay them.</p>

<p class='c001'>A total bankruptcy, therefore, coming upon England, either
from a decay of her trade, or a disturbance in collecting the public
revenue, would have the effect of plunging the nation into utter
ruin at home: what might be the consequences from abroad, I
leave to the reader’s sagacity to determine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me now suppose a bankruptcy to take place from a deliberate
act of power, with a view of expediency.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference between the two consists only in this; that in the
first, all the consequences we have mentioned would follow one upon
another, without a possibility of preventing them: in the
other, a plan to prevent them might be concerted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me then suppose, that government shall find it expedient, at
any time, to use a spunge for the public debts; that they shall fear
no external bad consequences, either from the resentment of those
states who may be hurt by it, or from the ambition of others who
may profit by it; that they shall cooly resolve to sacrifice the interest
of all the creditors in favour of the whole body; and that they
shall deliberate upon the plan to be followed, in order to bring
about so great a revolution, without essentially hurting any interest
in the state, that of the creditors alone excepted.</p>

<p class='c001'>In that case, I imagine, they would begin by ordering the amount
of all that is paid to the creditors, to be set apart as a fund for the
execution of the plan.</p>

<p class='c001'>They would purchase all over England, every article of produce
and manufacture which might remain upon hand for want of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>market: they would feed all those who would be forced to be idle
for want of employment: they would instantly put proper employments
into their hands; one week’s delay in the execution of
this part of the plan would throw the manufacturing interest into
such confusion, as to be past all remedy: they would furnish credit
to all the merchants subsisting, in proportion to what they had
lost by the extinction of the funds: they would establish offices
every where, to supply the wants of those who would be totally
ruined, until by degrees they could re-establish confidence, the
parent of trade, the mother of industry. By such precautions, properly
taken, and properly executed, none would suffer but the unhappy
creditors and their families, who, from great opulence,
would be reduced to poverty.</p>

<p class='c001'>As far as human prudence is insufficient for going through so
great a detail all at once; so far would the effects of a general bankruptcy
add hurtful consequences to those which in every case are
unavoidable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were a statesman endowed with the supernatural gift of turning
the minds of a nation at his will, and of foreseeing every consequence
before it happened, such a plan might be executed. Another
who, with the greatest capacity ever man was endowed with,
would, for expediency, not for necessity, deliberately undertake a
general bankruptcy, I should consider as a madman.</p>

<p class='c001'>I should rather prefer to submit to the natural consequences
which might result from an accidental bankruptcy, than endeavour
to avoid them by a plan too complicated for human wisdom to
execute.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next suppose the scheme to be fairly executed from a view
of expediency, no matter how, and all inconveniences prevented
during the execution, what would be gained by it?</p>

<p class='c001'>If by the supposition all taxes be kept alive, for at least a certain
time, in order to prevent a total confusion, certainly no body could
gain during that period; even the state itself would lose, because
every branch of consumption would infallibly diminish. But that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>time elapsed, and taxes reduced to the lowest, who would be the
gainers? We shall see when we come to the doctrine of taxation,
that a sudden abolition of them, in consequence of a bankruptcy,
would be advantageous to no body, but to creditors upon mortgage,
and to the idle: not to landlords; because their incomes would
diminish more than in the proportion of the present land-tax, at
least their improvements would be interrupted, and their rents ill
paid: not to the manufacturing classes; because at present they pay
no taxes, but in proportion to their idleness or extravagance, as shall
be proved: the monied interest, not secured on land, would I suppose
be extinguished; trade and credit at an end. The gains then
would be confined to those who have money secured upon land,
where the capital is demandable. In such a situation, interest
would rise beyond all bounds; and a debt which might have been
considered as a trifle before, might then carry off an estate. The
idle also who live peaceably upon a very moderate income, would
find a great advantage from the fall of prices for want of consumption,
and from the distress of the industrious; but the indigent
poor, who are supported from charity, would suffer: all the
great establishments for labour and industry, would fall to the
ground: the numbers of poor who are there maintained, would
come upon a society, which is beginning to lose those tender feelings
of compassion, which are more common in countries of idleness,
in proportion as misery is more familiarly before them.</p>

<p class='c001'>To say all in one word, a total bankruptcy, and abolition of taxes,
would bring this nation back to the situation it was in before taxes
and debts were known.</p>

<p class='c001'>Does any body imagine that our present situation is not analogous
to our present policy, and that it is possible that independently of
the same circumstances we should long continue to enjoy the advantages
we feel? No: were we in the same situation as formerly,
we should feel as our fathers felt. They had as good understandings
to improve their circumstances as we have; but they had to
do with an idle, we with an industrious common people. Trade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>and credit have been long at work to perform this great revolution:
the operation is not as yet compleated, and a total bankruptcy
now would destroy every good effect for a long time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were taxes made to cease, the large sums which proceed from
them would disappear entirely. Money would not, as some imagine,
be equally distributed among those who now pay the taxes, and so
proportionally increase every man’s income. The reason is plain:
the money paid for taxes, circulates; because it is demanded.
Were taxes suppressed, people having less occasion for money than
formerly, would circulate less in proportion. It is the necessity of
paying taxes, which <em>creates</em> this money for the payment of them;
and when this method of <em>creating</em> is not contrived, the taxes cannot
be paid, as has been often said. Now it is this great flux of money
from taxes which animates the trade of England: take them out
of the circle, what becomes of the whole?</p>

<p class='c001'>To suppose, therefore, so great a revolution in the circulation of
a country, as that produced by the cessation of taxes; and to suppose
no interruption from it upon the state of industry, and the
employment of the people of this nation, is a proposition I must
reject, as being contrary to all principles; and to this among the rest,
that it would be a most sudden, and a most violent revolution;
which throughout the whole course of this inquiry, we have found
to involve inconveniencies beyond the power of any theory to extricate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the whole we may determine, that the fatal consequences
of a bankruptcy would be many; and that the good resulting from
a total abolition of taxes, would be confined to two objects. 1. A
relief to those who pay them upon their possessions, or persons. 2. A
diminution of prices in favour of the idle at home, and of trade
abroad: great objects, no doubt, could they be obtained at less
expence than the consequences of a total failure of public credit and
domestic industry. Perhaps when we come to examine the principles
of taxation, we shall find that taxes do not raise prices so
much as is generally believed; and those which influence the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>application of public money, will point out better expedients than
a bankruptcy for comparing those great national purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>But let us suppose a case, which may possibly happen, as matters
seem to go on. Suppose, I say, that by continuing to carry on
long and expensive wars, the sum of interest paid to strangers
should exceed all that the nation can gain by her trade. In this case,
there must be a general balance of payments against her every
year, which very soon would manifest itself by the most fatal consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bank of England would be the first to feel them, by the departure
of all the coin and precious metals. Trade would feel them
next, and then indeed they would become universal.</p>

<p class='c001'>In such a situation, I fairly acknowlege, that I cannot discover
any expedient to avoid a bankruptcy. Engaging the foreign creditors
to become citizens, by the allurements of the greatest privileges,
and bills of naturalization, are vain speculations. Unless
some resource, hidden from me, should, upon such an occasion,
open itself, in the deep recesses of future events, I believe the nation
would soon be driven upon the fatal rock of bankruptcy. The
idea of a nation’s becoming bankrupt to itself, I have always
looked upon as a contradiction; but that it may become bankrupt
to the rest of the world, is quite consistent with reason and
common sense.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall not take upon me to suggest what mode of bankruptcy
would in such a case be the best; a total, or a partial one. The
partial, I am afraid, would, in England, work effects almost as
hurtful as the other. But if ever the case should happen, the
only way will be, to watch over every symptom of the approaching
catastrophe, and to improve circumstances to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of what infinite consequence is it then for a British statesman to
inquire into the amount of debts owing to strangers, and into the
state of the balance of trade? In speaking of exchange, I threw
out many things concerning the idea of putting that branch of business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>into the hands of the bank, in conjunction with the exchequer.
Were the state brought into the dilemma of either submitting
to this gradual decline of trade, from a cause which could
not be removed; or of being pushed to the necessity of leaping
into the terrible gulph of a deliberate bankruptcy; in such a dilemma,
I say, what infinite advantages might not be drawn from
the management of exchange?</p>

<p class='c001'>I have heard it said, that the debt owing to strangers was a great
advantage to England; because it drew people to that market
where their funds are settled. I allow all the force any one can
give to this proposition: But alas! what would it avail, whenever
England becomes incapable to furnish goods equivalent to all her
imports from abroad, added to all she owes to her foreign creditors?</p>

<p class='c001'>I am very far from supposing the present situation of England to
forebode the approach of any such disaster; but it is good to represent
to one’s self some determinate object, by which we may
judge of our situation in times to come.</p>

<p class='c001'>Debts have increased far beyond the imagination of every mortal.
Great men have uttered prophecies, which have proved false,
concerning the consequences of a debt of one hundred millions.
From this most people conclude, that they will go on until
some unforeseen accident shall dash the fabric to pieces. I have
been pretending to shew how they may go on in a perpetual chain.
But alas! one fatal combination was there omitted; and now
that it has been taken in, I think it serves as a datum, to resolve
the most important problem of this science, viz. How to determine
the exact extent of public credit. The solution of which is,
That it is not necessary that public credit should ever fail, from
any augmentation of debts whatever, due to natives; and that it
must fail, so soon as the nation becomes totally unable either to
export commodities equal to all their imports and foreign debts,
or to pay off a proportional part of their capital, sufficient to turn
the balance to the right side.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>From this proposition two corollaries may be drawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, That the most important object in paying off debts, is to
get quit of those due to strangers.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, That whatever circumstance has a tendency towards diminishing
the burden of foreign debts, should be encouraged.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be said, that whenever our foreign debts exceed the balance
of our trade, the best way would be to break faith with strangers,
and keep it with the subjects of the state: I answer, that were the
thing possible, which I apprehend it is not, the consequence might
prove equally hurtful.</p>

<p class='c001'>The greatest of all the inconveniencies proceeding from a bankruptcy,
is the ruin of industry, and the stop put to circulation. Can
it then be supposed, that a country might execute so glaring a
scheme of treachery to all her neighbours, and still continue her
correspondence with them in the open way of trade? Certainly
not. Were all foreign trade to be stopt at once, what a revolution
would it occasion! The circulation of foreign trade, in the city of
London only, exceeds perhaps the amount of all the taxes. A stop
put to that would occasion such a stagnation, as would ruin the
nation as much as if the bankruptcy were to become universal.
I do not here pretend minutely to trace consequences, which are
infinite: all that can be done, is to suggest hints, which every one
may pursue, in proportion to the extent of his combinations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The intention of touching upon this subject at all, is to shew,
that the expedient of a spunge, which is frequently talked of as a
remedy against the consequence of debts, is, perhaps, more dangerous
than any thing that can be feared from them. The reason
is, that the spunge implies a more sudden bankruptcy than any
one brought on in a gradual way, by natural causes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were natural and irresistible causes to operate a total failure of
all profit upon the trade of Britain, one cannot say how far the
other nations of Europe might not find it their interest to assist <em>us</em>,
providing we did our utmost to preserve our good faith to <em>them</em>.
And as I think I have made it sufficiently evident that nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>can be gained by openly violating such engagements, the best resolution
a nation can take, is to adhere to them to the last extremity,
and to banish from their thoughts every idea which may be
repugnant to them.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h4 id='ch4.4.10' class='c015'>CHAP. X. <br /> <i>Methods of contracting and paying off Public Debts.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>We are now to collect together, in one view, the several methods
of contracting and paying off the debts of a nation.
Such methods may be deduced, either from principles, or from
what practice has pointed out.</p>

<p class='c001'>The foundation upon which public credit is built, is the existence
of a sure and sufficient fund for performing the engagements
contracted.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, in the early times of public credit, the repayment of the
capital was the chief object of the lender, a much more extensive
fund was necessary than at present, when no more is required
than the payment of the interest. As such funds never can be
formed but from taxes, or general contributions from the people,
the greater they are, the larger must the contribution be. Whenever
therefore there is occasion to contract debt, the chief object of
a statesman’s care should be, to model the spirit of his people so as
to dispose them to concur in the proper resolutions to render the
plan proposed as easy as possible in the execution.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, the body of the people must be made sensible
that the consequence of contracting debts must imply a diminution
upon the income of some individuals; but that the fewer the
obstacles thrown in the way of the loan are, the less will that diminution
be.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>In the second place, he must gain the confidence of his people,
so far as to impress them with a firm belief that he will consult
<em>their</em> good, and nothing else, in what he undertakes.</p>

<p class='c001'>And in the last place, he must gain the confidence of those from
whom he is to borrow; and convince them that all covenants between
the public and them will be religiously performed.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a limited and free government, these three requisites are
essential to the firm establishment of public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where the power of the statesman is unlimited, he may substitute
his authority over the people, in the place of confidence; but
with respect to those who are to lend, he will find no room for any
such substitution: confidence <em>here</em> is the only expedient.</p>

<p class='c001'>All therefore that is required as to the people, is to <em>enable</em> them
to do what he requires of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>For that purpose he must establish credit with them, for finding
the contributions he is to exact of them; because they will have
as much occasion for it, in paying what is demanded of them by
authority, as he himself has in paying what he is obliged to in
consequence of his engagements.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this general plan be not followed, the consequence will
be, that taxes will fail on one hand, and public credit on the
other.</p>

<p class='c001'>If all this operation cannot be previously concerted, the plan of
borrowing must be circumscribed to funds previously established.</p>

<p class='c001'>When money is borrowed before the fund is prepared, every
obstacle which occurs in establishing it is a drawback upon the
confidence of those who lend, and renders the conditions less favourable
to the state which borrows.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the contract of loan, the first article to be agreed upon is the
rate of interest. We have, in the beginning of this book, examined
the causes of its rise and fall; and have in general determined,
that when the demand is for borrowing, interest rises;
when for lending, interest falls.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>As the object of the borrower is to have interest low, the statesman
who intends to borrow, must use all possible means to increase
the quantity of money in circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if coin alone be used as money, and if this coin be sent out
of the country, when borrowed, and if what is sent away cannot
be replaced at will, the scheme of augmenting money becomes
impracticable: it will daily become more scarce, more difficult to
procure, and interest must rise higher every day. Symbolical or
paper money, that is credit, must then be established at home,
upon the firmest basis: this will enable every one to pay what he
owes; consequently, the taxes will be paid, the creditors will receive
what is due to them regularly, money will every year augment
in proportion as debts are contracted; and if borrowing do
not augment beyond that proportion, interest will not rise; and if
borrowing should fall below that proportion, interest will sink.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is not this whole doctrine verified in the strongest manner by the
operation of the Missisippi? At the death of the late King of
France, money had disappeared. Some years before, he had, for
seven millions in coin, engaged his kingdom for thirty-two millions;
upon a distant fund indeed, but still it became a debt to be
paid. Paper money had not been introduced three years, when
interest fell to 2 <i>per cent.</i> The paper indeed was a bubble <em>in fact</em>;
but we have shewn that it became so from bad management only.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the augmentation of money, capitals cease to be so valuable.
By the melting down of property, the very capital, though in the
hands of the state, may be turned into money by the creditor,
whenever he has occasion for it; in the same way as the coin
which is buried in the vaults of the town-house of Amsterdam, is
constantly performing all the uses of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method, therefore, of borrowing money to the best advantage,
is previously to establish a fund of credit, arising from
annual taxes; to provide the people who are to pay them with
money in proportion to their property or industry; and to prevent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>the latter from ever failing for want of the medium, money, for
carrying it on.</p>

<p class='c001'>So long as interest stands high, relatively to other states with
which you are at war, throw as much money as possible into the
hands of your creditors, in payment of the debts already contracted;
because the more you throw in there, the more you will
draw out, if you have occasion to borrow more; and if you have
no occasion to borrow more, the lower you will reduce the interest,
by augmenting the fund of money to be lent.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these principles I conclude, that every nation which sets
out by contracting debts with its own citizens, must <em>begin</em> by borrowing
upon condition of repaying the capital in a short term of
years. This is also the best method to engage the people to contribute
largely without murmuring. The reason is, that when
taxes begin to be imposed, the mass of circulation becomes proportionally
augmented; and the paying back considerable sums to
the creditors, prevents, on the one hand, the debts from increasing
so fast, and supplies circulation, and facilitates new borrowings
on the other. While this plan of augmenting circulation
is carrying on, the statesman must prevent his expence abroad
from diminishing it proportionally at home. This is to be accomplished
by opening loans for foreign expence in foreign countries,
and by paying the <em>interest only</em> of such loans, with the greatest punctuality.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difficulty of performing this, is no argument against it. It
must either be done, or credit will be hurt; because without obtaining
credit abroad, it is impossible to defray any expence incurred
abroad, beyond what the metals of your country and the exports
from it can pay: that is, in other words, beyond the quantity of
metals exported, and general balance in your favour upon all reciprocal
payments with the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be said, that nations never pay the interest of their debts any
where but at home, I answer, that it is so much the worse for them;
because wherever the debts or interest is to be paid, the lender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>always states his account as if the payment were made in his own
house. All the expence to him of sending his money to the place
of subscription, and of drawing back his returns, are compared
with the interest offered by the borrower; and if upon the whole
<a id='corr469.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='he'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_469.5'><ins class='correction' title='he'>the</ins></a></span> lender finds his account in the bargain, he subscribes; otherwise
not. Since therefore the money borrowed must in this case be
sent abroad, it is an advantage for the borrower to be under an obligation
to provide a method of sending it; and by that means he
will borrow cheaper than he can do, when he refunds to every
lender all his expence and trouble in getting his interest remitted
to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am now deducing principles, and therefore shall not enter into
a discussion of the many objections which occur against this plan,
from foreign considerations; such as the facility it might procure
to a statesman of defrauding his foreign creditors, and several others
which might be formed: all I say is, that this is a cheaper and more
systematical way of borrowing, and it has this good effect, that
it constantly points out the state of the external debt, from which
alone a bankruptcy is to be feared.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were a favourable balance to return after an expensive war, the
payment of this foreign debt would be the consequence, as much
as now when the payment is made at home, and rather more so;
because who ever owed a balance (to England, I suppose) would
then pay his debts at London, with money due by England, payable
at Antwerp, for example; consequently, he would transfer at
discount; and when he transferred in favour of an Englishman,
the debts may be considered as discharged upon the foreign fund,
and stated a-new upon the funds payable in London. Could the
payment of the interest of the public debts be rendred susceptible
of such transfers upon all occasions, it would, I imagine, have a
remarkable effect in favour of public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>This thought suggested itself, while I was considering the situation
of a country where borrowing is in its infancy; and it
occurred as an expedient <em>for preventing foreign expence from draining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>the country of the money necessary for circulation at home.</em> <em>This</em>, in every
combination of circumstances, is the most important object of a
statesman’s care, while he is engaged in wars abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now whether the money of a country be paper or coin, it is
equally taken out of circulation, by every foreign payment. When
it is coin, it goes out of the country, as well as out of circulation:
when it is paper, it does not go out of the country, certainly, but
by coming upon the debtor in it for payment, it is equally taken
out of circulation; and what the debtor gives for it (viz. a bill of
exchange upon another country) goes out of the country. And
unless that bill of exchange can be paid with value exported in
merchandize, it will remain a debt upon the country, contracted
in favour of some other nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This I hope will be sufficient to recall to mind what has been so
fully explained in the 13th chapter upon banks; where the same
question was stated with regard to the payments Scotland was
obliged to make to England, towards the end of last war. The same
principles operate in the case before us, and may be applied to
every circumstance of it; with this difference only, that here the
statesman’s interest is more closely connected with that of his banks
than was the case during the distress in Scotland: because if he
does not support them by a systematical chain of conduct, he will
drain the fund of circulation by his remittances; his credit will
fail; his taxes will not be paid; and his people will be oppressed.
But if he pursues his plan systematically, circulation will be kept
full; his credit will be supported; his taxes will be paid; his
people will be easy: because no check will be put either to industry
or to consumption for want of money; a great part of the former
solid property will be melted down into money; whatever part of
that money is lent to the state will be, by that operation, consolidated
into a new species of property, the public funds; and if after
the borrowing scheme is over (that is, when peace is restored)
circulation should be contracted, a part of the money will stagnate
in the hands of individuals, and will, in their favour, be realized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>in that part of the solid property which was melted down in order
to produce it. That is, lands will be sold by the former proprietors,
and will be acquired by those who have money not realized
in stock; and for which circulation has no farther demand.
This is the reason why, at the end of every war which has run the
nation in debt, lands have constantly risen in their value, even
when considerable quantities of them have been offered to sale.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be said that the stock-holders are those whom we commonly
see buying the lands, and not those who have sums not realized:</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall, in answer, observe, that the stock-holders can only buy
lands by selling their stock, to those who have money not realized;
so it is still the money not realized which is employed in buying
every article of solid property: and even after that operation, the
money still remains in circulation; because it is impossible to realize
even paper money itself, except when the creditor in it becomes
proprietor of the property upon which it is secured; and if the money
be coin, it is plain that this cannot be realized any farther than
it is by nature. When therefore we say, that a man realizes his
money, we do not mean any thing farther, than that he gives his
money to another in exchange for solid property. Thus when an
estate is bought in a country where banks upon mortgage are established,
a part of the price is commonly taken out of circulation
altogether; because in consequence of the price paid, the bank is
refunded what it had melted down of the land sold; consequently,
that paper becomes consolidated a-new, as it were, with the lands
which are relieved of the mortgage.</p>

<p class='c001'>But when lands are sold in a country where there is no paper,
the price remains in circulation as before; and if the quantity of
coin in circulation should exceed the uses for it, a case which
seldom happens in these days, it would be exported, and realized
abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>When this complicated and systematical scheme of credit is not
established, the infallible consequence is, that money disappears:
consequently, interest rises. The taxes formerly imposed cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>paid: consequently, it is in vain to seek to augment them; because
in proportion as they are augmented, they become less productive.
If money be borrowed upon remote funds, engaged for other debts
previously contracted, and if public faith be at all events to be preserved,
the consequence must then be, that the public will be eat
up by usurers.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was the case in England during the wars of Queen Anne.</p>

<p class='c001'>So early as 1706, government, as has been said, began to borrow
at 6 <i>per cent.</i> upon funds already engaged. What was the consequence?
The exchequer having no money to pay the interest as it
fell due, paid with tallies; these fell to great discount, and had
they remained long in that discredited situation, lending would
have stopt, or interest would have risen, as in France, so high as to
lose the name of interest altogether. This was the case, in the
example above cited, when seven millions ready money, borrowed
by the late King of France, became a debt of thirty-two millions on
the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the occasion above mentioned, government availed themselves
of the bank of England, as I say every private citizen should
have a power to do, on every occasion, when his credit is good, though
money should fail him. They engaged the bank to discount all
tallies issued for interest of debts; that is, in other words, to turn
those sticks into money: but as public credit was so low that money
could not be found to discharge even the interest of the advance
made by the bank, the government consented, that all advances of
that kind should bear compound interest quarterly, at 6 <i>per cent.</i>
What a monstrous profit to the bank! what a charge upon the
state! Had banks of circulation upon mortgages been established
at that time, money would have come in at a moderate simple interest
to individuals, who would have availed themselves of them,
for the payment of all public burdens. Instead of which, industry
was made to suffer; the public money did not come in; taxation
stopt; expences went on, and deficiencies were paid by the public
at this monstrous charge.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>On the other hand, had it not been for the assistance the bank
then gave the state, in circulating those exchequer tallies, bills, &amp;c.
it is very certain that credit would have failed as totally in England
as it had done in France in 1708, when Desmaretz undertook the
finances. This minister had no bank to avail himself of, and accordingly
he run France in debt at the rate of two hundred millions
of livres <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>, during seven campaigns; of which, I am persuaded,
he did not receive one half, or near it, in effective value.</p>

<p class='c001'>What I have said will, I hope, be sufficient to shew that the only
way for any state to borrow, is previously to provide a fund for
making good what is agreed upon with the lenders; and that all
expedients to supply the want of it will in the end bring great expence
upon the people, either by involving them in an excessive burden
of debts, in case public engagements should be held sacred, as has
constantly been the case in Great Britain; or by driving the state to
a bankruptcy, as was the case in France upon the death of the late
King. I call it a bankruptcy, because <em>all</em> that was owing was not
paid. A man who pays no more than 19<i>s.</i> 11¾<i>d.</i> in the pound, is
a bankrupt, as well as he who cannot pay one farthing.</p>

<p class='c001'>I now come to the methods of paying off debts when already
contracted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public debts may be divided into two classes, redeemable and irredeemable.
Redeemable debts may be paid off in several ways,
which we shall briefly enumerate before we compare their several
advantages.</p>

<p class='c001'>First then, such <em>debts</em> may be paid off at once, by refunding to
the creditors the whole capital, with all arrears of interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, <em>They</em> may be paid off yearly, according to a certain rule to
determine the preference, and order of payment: for this purpose,
a determinate sum must be set apart as a sinking fund.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, <em>They</em> may be paid off cumulatively and proportionally every
year, by incorporating the sinking fund into the money appropriated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>for discharging the interest, and by placing all that is paid beyond
the interest, as payment in part of the capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, <em>They</em> may be paid in one sense, as shall be farther explained,
by reducing the interest upon the capitals, without diminishing
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>5<i>to</i>, <em>They</em> may be paid off by converting them into annuities for
lives.</p>

<p class='c001'>6<i>to</i>, And lastly, <em>they</em> may be paid off under the value of the capitals,
by the means of lotteries; where the state may gain what the
creditors choose to lose from a desire of gaining.</p>

<p class='c001'>To one or other of these methods may be reduced all the fair and
honest expedients which a state may employ to get rid of their debts,
without any breach of public faith, or without proceeding to the
extremity of prescribing conditions of payment, which the creditors
are forced to accept against their will.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the irredeemable debts, I apprehend, that, without consent
of the creditors, no change upon the condition of loan can justly
be made.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall next point out the advantages and disadvantages of the
several methods of discharging debts, as they may affect the separate,
or cumulative interest of a state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were large debts which have subsisted for a long time to be paid
off all at once, it would occasion a sudden and a violent revolution,
which is always attended with inconveniences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were, for example, the proprietors of lands to consent to sell off
a part of their estates for the payment of the public debts, the
quantity of land brought to market, would sink the price of it very
considerably; from which would arise a great detriment to landlords.
I shall not here inquire from whence such a sum of money
could come.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could a treasure be brought from India (let me suppose) sufficient
at once to discharge the debts of Great Britain, circulation would
become so glutted with money, that interest would fall to nothing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>This would be a temporary loss to all the former creditors, until
they had time to lend to the other states of Europe, who would, in
consequence of the revolution, sink the rate of interest upon their
own debts. Something like this was the consequence of paying
off all the debts of France with bank notes in 1720, upon which interest
fell, as we have observed above, to 2 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>When, in the second place, debts are paid off partially every year,
according to a certain rule, it is expedient to have the capitals reduced
into shares of a determinate value, as is the practice in
France, that they may be drawn out as in a lottery. The lots drawn
may then be paid, and no detriment will follow to any particular
creditor, more than to another: because if by being paid there be
either profit or loss to the creditor, it will affect the value of the
whole stock in proportion. If, upon the establishment of such a
plan, the stock be found to rise, it will be a proof that either the
interest formerly paid was below the common rate, or that the
credit of the state was looked upon as precarious: if it should sink,
contrary conclusions may safely be drawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a common method of paying off debts in France, where
funds are more commonly divided into shares than in Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1759, the King opened a subscription for seventy-two millions
of livres upon the general farms: this sum was divided into seventy-two
thousand actions, bearing 5 <i>per cent.</i> and it was stipulated, that
upon the renewal of the farms in 1762, twelve thousand actions
should be drawn by lot, and paid off monthly; so that in six months
the whole debt was to be discharged.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third method of applying what is annually paid above the
interest, in extinction of the capital, is the measure proposed by
Cardinal Richlieu for discharging the debts of France; only the
Cardinal went to work in a very arbitrary way, both in determining
the interest, and in fixing a value upon the capital, equally detrimental
to the creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>To apply this to an example. Had England at the time government
first established a sinking fund, arising out of the savings which
were made upon reducing the rate of interest, from time to time,
continued to pay to the creditors the same annual sums as formerly;
and thereby applied what was paid beyond the interest, to the payment
of the capital, there could not have been any misapplication
of the sinking fund; and the debts by this time would have been
greatly diminished. Whereas by applying the sinking fund to the
service of the year, for the ease of the people and advantage of the
creditors, the consequences <em>may</em> prove exceedingly inconvenient.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth method of reducing debts is that adopted by Great
Britain, viz. by reducing the interest paid upon them. From this
we discover the reason why taxes, even in time of war, are seldom
augmented in this kingdom much above the proportion of the interest
of the money borrowed.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have, in the second chapter of the first book, boldly declared
this to be against principles, and the authors of such a scheme were
there stigmatized as men of no foresight: we now see how much
people may be mistaken in their conclusions in political matters,
when they are formed upon too narrow combinations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were capitals intended <em>ever</em> to be paid, no doubt the conclusion
would be just; but if it be resolved, that capitals shall never be considered
as the object of attention, and that the interest alone shall be
looked upon as the real burden, then all payment of capitals is unnecessary,
except so far as by paying a part of them, it may serve
to reduce the interest upon the rest, by making money regorge in
the market beyond the uses found for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This plan cannot be carried on while a nation is engaged in an
expensive war, which absorbs all the money to be lent: but it becomes
the object of a statesman’s care, after peace is restored, and
when trade begins to bring in a balance upon exportations.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen how that balance tends every year to diminish the
capitals due to strangers, and to keep money at home. Then is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>time to extend taxation beyond the uses found for money to pay the
interest. Two or three millions extraordinary, raised at the close
of a war, and thrown into the hands of the creditors of Great Britain,
in extinction of their capitals, would soon engage them to cry
for mercy. They would find no outlet but France for such sums;
and it is precisely after a war, that France is busy in playing off the
arbitrary operations on her debts, which reduces her credit too low
for any one to trust her with money. Let peace continue for a few
years, confidence will there advance apace, and then it will become
more difficult to make money regorge in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>To say that taxes are already beyond all bounds, is, in other
words, to say the nation is no more in a state of defence: because
should Britain be again involved in an unavoidable war, the consequence
will be, either to render more taxes indispensable, or
to oblige the nation to submit to any terms demanded by her
enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be therefore true, that taxes may still be augmented, the
most proper time for augmenting them, is, at the very close of a
war; because then every circumstance favours the scheme, as we
shall now explain.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have said above, and experience proves the truth of it, that
at the end of a war circulation becomes too full for domestic uses;
and that the superfluity of money is realized upon property. This
is the consequence of a sudden stop in national expence. Were taxes
at such a time augmented, part of this regorging money would find
a vent by the augmentation upon domestic circulation which taxes
would occasion; which augmentation would circulate into the exchequer,
instead of becoming consolidated with property, as has
been said, and coming into the hands of government, would be
poured into those of the creditors, in payment of part of their capitals.
There it would regorge a-new; because it is observed, in general,
that those who have property in the funds are not apt to
squander money when unexpectedly thrown into their hands; on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>the contrary, they are commonly found to live very much within
their income<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f37'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. Experience shews, that when the debts of a nation have come to a height, the
public creditors become people of great consequence, upon account of the ease and
affluence of their circumstances. They are not exposed to the many hidden expences
incident to land proprietors. They are a class in the state but lately known; the capital
of their wealth is hid; and opinions concerning their figure and rank are as yet unformed.
Whereas the family of a land proprietor is known; his expence <em>may surpass</em>
that of his predecessors without much observation; but if it should <em>fall below</em> it, he
commonly sinks in the estimation of his neighbours, who seldom combine circumstances
which can only be guessed at. An heir to a landed estate, is bred up from his infancy
with the notion of living like his father: the son of a monied man has commonly very
different sentiments; and even when any of this class takes a turn to expence, the
lustre of it is all displayed round their own bodies; that is, in their own house,
and in their own families: no country seats, hounds, horses, servants in every quarter,
family interest to keep up, little oeconomy in spending. In a word, every one feels
better than I can describe, that landed men commonly exceed, and monied men commonly
live within their income.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But suppose it should not immediately regorge, it would then
increase expence and consumption; consequently, would advance
industry, and render every branch of excises more productive. In
every combination we can form, public opulence would be augmented:
money would regorge at last; and then the creditors
would come with their application to government to suspend the
reimbursement of capitals, and to accept, in lieu of that, a diminution
upon the interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the golden opportunity for diminishing the public burden
occasioned by debts; and this method of compassing so desirable an
end, is far preferable to that of compelling creditors to submit to a
diminution, by offering a sudden reimbursement, which was put
in practice in Britain in the year 1749, as has been observed. Had
the public waited with patience one year longer, and then thrown
in a few millions more than they did into the hands of the creditors,
the proposal of reducing the interest would have come from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>the other quarter; which in all bargains with creditors is of the
greatest consequence to the debtor.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sum of interest thus diminished, upon an obligation to suspend
the reimbursements of capitals for a limited time, three questions
will naturally occur: 1. Whether the taxes should be diminished
in proportion: or 2. If they should be allowed to subsist with
a view to apply the overplus of them to national purposes: or 3.
Whether it may not be most adviseable to turn such a part of the
debts into annuities for lives, as may absorb the saving upon the
former interest paid. The first two questions I reserve for the following
book, where they will be fully examined; the last is the
fifth expedient proposed for acquitting the public debts. As the
nature of it is abundantly evident, I shall only repeat what I formerly
observed, that this method of establishing a sinking fund,
has the advantage of being less exposed to misapplications than any
other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last expedient of paying off capitals, below the original value,
by the means of lotteries, should only take place after interest is
brought so low as to cut off any near prospect of reducing it still
farther.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall not pretend to guess at the lowest point to which the rate
of interest may be brought, by the expedients of increasing money
at will, by the means of banks upon mortgage. I have in the
seventh chapter of the first part of this book, thrown out a hint of
a land-bank, which opens a very wide field of speculation; but in
this place, it would be unnecessary to enlarge upon that subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me suppose the rate of interest brought lower in Britain than
anywhere else, it will nevertheless be subject to periodical risings,
on many occasions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon every such emergency, capitals will sink in the market
below par.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is then <em>only</em> that a state can have recourse to this last expedient
of opening lotteries, and taking in subscriptions at the market price
of the funds subscribed into them. And although the annuities to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>be paid upon the lottery fund be regulated by the rate of interest
at the time, and consequently considerably above the standard of
the other debts; yet the same methods of reducing it afterwards
will constantly produce their effects, and thereby diminish the capital
by degrees.</p>

<p class='c001'>In like manner, in time of war, when the public funds fall
greatly in their price, government may open new subscriptions,
and receive payment for them in their own paper at the market
price, allowing a small premium in the rate of interest. If the
creditors willingly subscribe upon these conditions, no violation of
public faith can be alledged. By this operation, the capitals will
be diminished, and the advanced rate of interest paid during the
war, will return upon the peace to where it was: then the new
subscriptions may be paid off, or subscribed for again at a lower
rate than before.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose it then resolved, that in time of war, the nation’s creditors
should be allowed, at certain times, to subscribe their capitals
in books opened at the bank for that purpose, one quarter <i>per cent.</i>
above the selling price. Would not this have the good effect of
supporting the price of stocks on one hand, and of reducing the
capital of the national debt upon the other? Example.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me suppose that in time of war, the 3 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per cents.</i></span> sell at 74¾,
might not government receive them at 75, and constitute the new
subscription at 4 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per cent.</i></span>? What interest could any one have not to
subscribe, who at such a time intends to sell his stock? His 3 <i>per
cent.</i> sold to government at 75, and turned into a 4 <i>per cent.</i> would
afterwards, when sold in the market, produce ¼ <i>per cent.</i> more than
if it had not been subscribed into the new fund.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps in Change alley, where calculation is carried to the utmost
pitch of refinement, even this eventual advantage to government
might sink the value of the new 4 <i>per cents.</i> Let this be allowed.
The answer is, that when people compute with such nicety, and
comprehend in their calculations every circumstance the most minute,
it is, I think, the interest of a state (whose views should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>extend far beyond the period of human life) to grant a premium
upon such subscriptions more than sufficient to indemnify the subscribers,
according to the most rigid calculation concerning their
present advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The smallest profit to be discovered by the nicest pen will engage
the monied man to subscribe; consequently, the capitals of debts
may be diminished, at a loss to the public almost imperceptible.
And for this imperceptible loss in the mean time, the greatest national
advantage may be obtained at a distant period.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is now full time to close this book, which has swelled far beyond
its due proportion. The subject of credit and debts is so connected
with many questions relating to taxes, and to the application
of their amount, that the connection of the subject would have suffered
little in blending them together. But as I find it is a great
relief to the memory to interpose, now and then, a pause; and as
taxes were intended to be treated of by themselves, according to
the plan I at first proposed, I shall make no alteration in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the end of the first and second books, I subjoined a chapter of
recapitulation; in the third book, this was supplied by a very full
table of contents; here, because of the intimate connection of the
subject of this and the following book, I shall refer the reader to
the end of the volume, for a full recapitulation of both.</p>

</div>

<hr class='c006' />
<h3 id='ch5.In' class='c015'>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The subject of taxes is so closely connected with every branch
of political oeconomy, that I have not been able to avoid
anticipating a subject, which, according to my plan, is left for the
conclusion of this work.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has been hitherto introduced concerning taxation, in treating
of industry, trade, money, credit, and debts, relates principally
to the effects of taxes upon circulation, prices, and several other
things relatively to those subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>What therefore remains, not as yet touched upon, chiefly concerns
the principles which determine the nature of every tax, relatively
to the interest it is intended to affect.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>To investigate the different consequences of taxes when imposed
upon possessions, and when upon consumption, are questions
which relate directly to the principles of taxation. But in this
book I shall also have occasion to trace out, farther than as yet I
have done, certain combinations concerning the effects which taxes
have in multiplying the fund of circulation: and as the augmentation
of taxes tends greatly to increase money, I am thence led to
examine, how far the advantage gained by the suppression of taxes
may not be more than compensated to a nation, by the inconveniences
proceeding from so great a diminution of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes have all along been supposed to enhance the price of living;
we shall therefore have an opportunity of investigating the
proper extent to be allowed to that general proposition.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>
  <h3 id='ch5.1' class='c013'>CHAP. I. <br /> <i>Of the different Kinds of Taxes.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Taxes have been established in all ages of the world, under
different names of tribute, tithe, tally, impost, duty, gabel,
custom, subsidy, excise; and many others needless to recapitulate,
and foreign to my subject to examine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though in every species of this voluminous category, there are
certain characteristic differences; yet one principle prevails in all,
upon which the definition may be founded.</p>

<p class='c001'>I understand therefore by <em>tax</em>, in its most general acceptation, <em>a
certain contribution of fruits, service, or money, imposed upon the individuals
of a state, by the act or consent of the legislature, in order to defray the expences
of government</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This definition may, I think, include, in general, all kinds of
burdens which can possibly be imposed. By fruits are understood
either those of the earth, of animals, or of man himself. By service,
whatever man can either by labour or ingenuity produce,
while he himself remains free. And under money is comprehended
the equivalent given for what may be exacted in the other two
ways.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have no occasion to consider the nature of such taxes as are not
in use in our days. Tributes of slaves from conquered nations are
as little known in our times, as contributions of subsistence from
the subjects of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>I divide, therefore, modern taxes into three classes. 1. Those
upon alienation, which I call proportional: 2. Those upon possessions,
which I call cumulative or arbitrary: and 3. Those exacted
in service, which I call personal. These terms must now be fully
explained, that I may use them hereafter without being misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>A proportional tax presents a simple notion.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is paid by the buyer, who intends to consume, at the time of
the consumption, while the balance of wealth is turning against
him; and is consolidated with the price of the commodity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Examples of this tax are all excises, customs, stamp-duties, postage,
coinage, and the like.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this definition, two requisites are necessary for fixing the tax
upon any one: first, he must be a buyer; secondly, he must be a
consumer. Let this be retained.</p>

<p class='c001'>A cumulative or arbitrary tax, presents various ideas at first sight,
and cannot well be defined until the nature of it has been illustrated
by examples.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be known, 1<i>mo</i>, By the intention of it; which is to affect the
possessor in such a manner as to make it difficult for him to augment
his income, in proportion to the tax he pays.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, By the object, when instead of being laid upon any determinate
piece of labour or consumption, it is made to affect past and
not present gains.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, By the circumstances under which it is levied, which imply
no transition of property from hand to hand, nor any change in
the balance of wealth between individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Examples of cumulative taxes are land-taxes, poll-taxes, window-taxes,
duties upon coaches and servants, that upon <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>industrie</i></span>, in
France, and many others.</p>

<p class='c001'>A personal tax is known by its affecting the person, not the purse
of those who are laid under it. Examples of it are the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>corvée</i></span>, in
France; the six days labour on the high roads, and the militia service
before pay was allowed, in England<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>corvée</i></span> in France is the personal service of all the labouring classes, for carrying
on public works. Were they paid for in money, it is computed they would amount
to no more than 1 200 000 livres a year. This tax was omitted in the account of the
French revenue.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Having thus explained what I mean by proportional, cumulative,
and personal taxes, it is proper to observe, that however different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>they may prove in their effects and consequences, they all agree in
this, that they ought to impair the fruits and not the fund; the
expences of the person taxed, not the savings; the services, not the
persons of those who do them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This holds true in every denomination of taxes. In former days,
when annual tributes of slaves were paid, and even at present
among the Turks, where it is customary to recruit the seraglios of
great men by such contributions, I consider the young women who
are sent, as part of the fruits of the people who send them. This
is a fundamental principle in taxation; and therefore public contributions,
which necessarily imply a diminution of any capital, cannot
properly be ranged under the head of taxes. Thus when the
Dutch contributed, not many years ago, the hundredth part of their
property towards the service of the state, I cannot properly consider
that in the light of a tax: it was indeed a most public spirited contribution,
and did more honour to that people, from the fidelity
with which it was made, than any thing of the kind ever boasted
of by a modern society.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h3 id='ch5.2' class='c013'>CHAP. II. <br /> <i>Of proportional Taxes, and their proper Object.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>Whatever exists for the use of man, so far as it is considered
as a fund for taxation, may be classed under the following
heads: 1. The produce or fruits of the earth; 2. the produce
of the industry of man; or 3. his personal service. Farther,</p>

<p class='c001'>Fruits cannot be obtained without the necessary labour of man
and cattle. As this labour presupposes all the necessary consumption
of maintenance, &amp;c. the produce of the land must be understood,
with regard to taxes, to be that part of the fruits only which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>remains after deducting an equivalent for all necessary expences in
making the earth produce them. The net produce alone of the
earth is to be considered as a fund liable to taxation; and every
contribution which bears not a just proportion to that quantity, is
wrong imposed, as shall be shewn as we go along.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, as to the produce of work: this cannot be brought into
existence without some expence, viz. the maintenance of the workman;
that is to say, his food, raiment, fire, lodging, and the expence
he is at for tools, and every other necessary. This we shall,
for the future, call his physical-necessary. The value of the work,
over and above an equivalent for these articles, is the only fund to
be taxed with regard to the workman.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to work itself, we have seen above (Book II. chap. 26.) in the
general distribution of things which may be purchased with money,
how it was ranged under the class of things incorporeal. For
that reason, the work performed cannot come under taxation; and
therefore the person working, who by work acquires a balance in
his favour, is brought to be affected by proportional taxes upon the
articles of his consumption; and when it is found that these articles
suffer no alienation before they are consumed by him, and consequently
escape taxation, then he may either be laid under the cumulative
taxes, which will affect his wealth, or under the personal,
which are paid in work itself, and in that respect may be considered
as the fruit of the man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing would be so easy as a general rule for imposing proportional
taxes, did the labourers of the ground actually consume a
part of the fruits of the earth, and the other industrious classes a
part of their own work, in lieu of this physical-necessary. In that
case, nothing but what remained of fruits and work, not already consumed
by the immediate producers, would come to market for the
use of those who do not work; but who have an equivalent to give
for it, out of the produce of past industry. Were that, I say, the
case, then at the time of alienation (or, as we expressed it in the
26th chapter of the second book, at the time when the balance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>wealth is going to turn in favour of the industrious, against the
idle consumer) a tax proportional to the value of the alienation
might, with the greatest propriety, be imposed, as we shall presently
discover.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, I hope, will recall to mind the principles deduced in the
chapter above cited, where we made it appear, how the industrious
classes, who furnish consumable commodities for the price of their
overplus, must constantly have the balance of wealth turning in
their favour: and when once they arrive at a certain degree of ease,
proportional to their ambition, then they give over working, and
become incorporated into the class of those who have enriched
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus matters go on in a perpetual circle. The industrious become
easy, and the public lays the consumers under a perpetual
contribution in proportion to their expence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hypothesis we have made, is not entirely agreeable to matter
of fact; because the operation of taxes is far more complex than
we have described it to be; but by simplifying it, as I have done, it
serves to give an idea of the result, or general consequence of proportional
taxes, which, when properly imposed, do affect the idle
only, but never the industrious.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were, I say, the operation of taxation as simple as we have represented
it, nothing would be more easy than to deduce its principles.
Nothing would come to be refunded to the labourer or workman,
at the sale of his surplus. This surplus would be equal to
the whole produce of the earth, and whole industry of the country,
deducting the physical-necessary of all the industrious; and this
physical-necessary need not then be deducted; because it is supposed
to be consumed in the very production of the surplus, as
the aqueous part of sea water is consumed before you can have
the salt.</p>

<p class='c001'>This illustrates what has been said, viz. that the fruits of the
earth are only to be reckoned to exist, after deducting the necessary
expence of providing them. For though in fact a farmer possesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>all his crop after harvest, yet part of it, <em>as to him</em>, is virtually consumed
out of his own stock, or that of others who have furnished
him food and necessaries all the time it was coming forward: consequently,
that part neither belongs to the ground, or to the farmer.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be urged still, that the whole must be supposed to exist with
regard to the state, I agree to the proposition; but according to our
argument, it must not be supposed to exist in favour of the state, to
the prejudice of the farmer; for this reason, that the total of the
farmer’s expence must be understood to have been taken from the
surplus of other people’s industry, and therefore if the crop be supposed
to exist with respect to the state, because it is in the farmer’s
yard, the surplus of industry which he has consumed must not be
supposed to exist in favour of the state, at the same time. But as
the farmer is supposed to have paid the tax upon what he has borrowed
and consumed, he must <em>draw it back</em> from those who, in their
turn, are to consume his crop: and if he draws it back, he cannot
be said to pay it, although the state profits of it as much as if he did.</p>

<p class='c001'>Does it not appear from this analysis, that a state can only take
gratuitously and proportionally out of the surplus of fruits and industry?
Now what is here called surplus, relatively to the industrious,
is the necessary fund of consumption for all the rich and
idle; consequently, were the state to diminish any part of the <em>quantity</em>,
the idle and the rich would be deprived of a sufficiency: but
in regard that those who do not work give money, which is the
price of all things, in exchange for what they consume, there the
state steps in, and says, we ask nothing of those who have nothing
but their physical-necessary, this they have been allowed to
take; we take none of their surplus from them, this we allow them
to sell to you: but as for you, who do not work, and have in your
coffers wherewithal to purchase the labours of your industrious
brethren, this labour you shall not profit of, unless you give the
state a certain value out of your wealth, in proportion to the work
and fruit you are going to consume, although you have contributed
nothing towards the production of it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>Hence it appears evident, that without <em>money</em> there could be no
tax imposed: for were the state to take their proportion of the real
surplus, and dispose of it out of the country, a part of the inhabitants
would be starved. But by an equivalent’s being found, quite
different from the surplus itself, of no use for subsistence, the
whole produce of industry is left for the use of those who have it;
the state takes what part of the equivalent they please from the idle;
and no body starves, but such as have not money, nor industry,
nor the talent of exciting the compassion of the charitable.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this simple representation of a most complicated operation,
I have been able to deduce the capital principle of proportional
taxation. If the reasoning be found solid, it may be retained;
because we shall have occasion to recur to it, at almost every new
combination.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h3 id='ch5.3' class='c013'>CHAP. III. <br /> <i>How proportional Taxes are drawn back by the industrious, and how that drawing back is the only reason why Taxes raise the Prices of Commodities.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>What perplexes our notions in the theory of proportional
taxation, is, that the industrious man, instead of bringing
his surplus to market, is obliged to bring the whole of his work.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me, therefore, suppose him to be creditor upon one part of
his work, and proprietor of the other. This will divide it, as it
were, into two parts, which I shall call (A) and (B).</p>

<p class='c001'>(A) represents that part upon which he is creditor, and answers
to all the expence he has already been at; that is, to his physical-necessary,
as we have called it. This we have said ought to be considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>as virtually consumed by the workman, and if a tax be
raised upon it, it must not affect <em>him</em>; that is, he must draw it
totally back from the person to whom he disposes of it. (B) on
the other hand, represents that part of which he is proprietor, to
wit, his profit; and therefore may either be taxed or not, as the
state shall think it.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be taxed in the hands of the industrious man, without suffering
an alienation, the tax will be of a cumulative nature. If it
be left free to him, and taxed to the person who buys it, it will be
of the proportional kind, as we shall see afterwards. Again,</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first case, it will check the growing wealth of the industrious
man; in the second, it will accelerate the dissipation of the
buyer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes, therefore, of the first kind, are proper to be imposed in
countries where the state is jealous of growing wealth, as we have
observed in the 25th chapter of the second book. If the tax, again,
be laid upon the buyer, then the balance turns in favour of the industrious
man, in proportion to the full amount of (B), and produces
no other effect than to accelerate the dissipation of the buyer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now take in a new combination.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, when the work is brought to market and sold, the price shall
not exceed the value of the industrious man’s (A), then he is of the
class of those we call <em>physical-necessarians</em>, who accumulate no profits.
If the price of it be less than (A), he becomes a load upon the state,
a bankrupt to those who have fed him upon credit, and will die for
want, unless he be supported by charity.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far with regard to the seller: next as to the buyer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The buyer appears at market with his money. When he comes
there he must give, first, an equivalent for the prime cost of the
merchandize; that is, he must refund every expence necessarily incurred
in producing it; or he must refund the value of (A). Next, the
industrious man has a claim upon him for his profits, viz. his (B).
Then comes the state, who claims a part of his wealth, in regard
that he is going to purchase what his own industry has not produced.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>This is the tax; I shall call it (C). This tax will be found
of the proportional kind. It will not affect the growing wealth of
the seller, but it will accelerate the dissipation of the buyer; and
will pull down the scale against him, in favour of the industrious.
This is a proper tax, in countries where the state observes the maxim
of sharing the wealth of those who dissipate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now take in another combination. Let us suppose this
buyer to be an industrious person, and the thing bought to be a necessary
material for the manufacture in which he is employed. Is
it not plain, that when the second industrious man comes to market
to sell his work, which I also suppose composed of his (A) and
his (B), that his (A) is a still more compounded body? It first includes
his own physical-necessary, as above: 2. the (A) and (B) of
the man from whom he bought the materials: and 3. the (C) which
he paid to the state for the liberty of acquiring what he himself
had not produced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whoever therefore buys from the second industrious man, must,
in like manner, refund to him his full (A); he must also pay him
his (B); and then he will find the state claiming their (C), as in the
former operation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being done, let us examine the interests of all parties. The
first industrious man has no reason to complain of the tax; because
he was paid his necessary expence (A), and also his (B) for his profit;
and the state realized the tax at the expence of the second industrious
man, who paid it. Now we said that the dissipation of
his wealth was accelerated in proportion to the value of what he
paid for (C); but as he is none of the idle, and as the thing bought
was a material necessary for his manufacture, the second buyer
finds himself obliged to refund the whole amount of the first (A),
(B), (C); because the sum of them make a part of the second man’s
(A). Now it is the refunding of this (C) to the industrious man
which is the only circumstance, from which proceeds the rise in
the price of commodities, in consequence of proportional taxes.
Moreover, the second buyer must pay the second industrious man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>(B), in favour of the balance which is going to turn against him;
and last of all, he must pay the second (C), which is the share the
state requires of him, in order to accelerate his dissipation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now let us observe, that if the commodity bought by the second
industrious man, be not necessary for the existence of his manufacture,
it cannot enter into his (A), and therefore must be diminished
upon his (B); and if his (B) cannot pay it, then he will owe
it to some body, and for the future must either abstain from such
expences, or leave off working, in favour of those who can live
without them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me illustrate all this by an example.</p>

<p class='c001'>A tanner sells his leather to a shoemaker; the shoemaker in paying
the tanner for his leather, pays the tanner’s subsistence and
profit, and the tax upon leather.</p>

<p class='c001'>The man who buys the shoes for his own consumption, refunds
all this to the shoemaker, together with his subsistence, profit, and
the tax upon shoes; consequently, the price of shoes are raised,
only by refunding the taxes paid by the industrious.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if the shoemaker’s subsistence shall happen to include either
tavern expences, or his consumption on idle days, he will not draw
these back; because other shoemakers who do not frequent the tavern,
and who are not idle, will undersell him: he must therefore
take his extraordinary expence out of his profits; and if his profit
be not sufficient, he must run in debt to the tavern-keeper.</p>

<p class='c001'>The extravagance and idleness, therefore, of particular workmen
does not check industry, nor raise prices; for these will always be in
proportion to demand, and there is no reason why demand should either
rise or fall, because a particular workman is extravagant, or consumes
a commodity not necessary for his manufacture or subsistence.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this example there arises a new combination: that in proportion
as the industrious do not consume of the produce of their
own industry, but come to market with the whole, and then purchase
the work of others, they are considered, as to taxes, in the
light of idle consumers, who do not work, but purchase with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>money the fruits of the industry of others. By this operation, the taxable
fund is augmented beyond the extent of the general surplus
called (B). The reason is plain. Whatever is brought to market
is supposed to be surplus, as it <em>may</em> there be bought by the idle, as
well as the industrious. The only difference is, that the first do
not draw back the tax, and that the second do, as we have already
shewn.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this reasoning we may conclude, that the way to carry proportional
taxes to their utmost extent, is to draw all commodities to
market, to engage every one to carry thither the whole produce of
his industry, and buy whatever he stands in need of.</p>

<p class='c001'>But which way will you engage either a farmer to sell his crop, and
buy subsistence from another; or a shoemaker to sell his own, and
buy his neighbour’s shoes? The thing is impracticable; and were
it attempted, it would prove an arbitrary proceeding, and a cumulative
tax laid upon their industry: a tax which, by the nature of
it, they cannot draw back, as we shall presently see, and from this
circumstance alone proceeds the whole oppression of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me next analize the price paid by the last buyer, whom we
have called the rich and idle consumer of the manufacture, who
can draw nothing back from any body.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not composed of the whole value of the subsistence, of the work,
of the profits, of the tax? The whole reimbursement of all former
payments and repayments lands upon him. Those who have been
at all the expence, appear in the light of his servants and agents,
who have only advanced money upon his account.</p>

<p class='c001'>How absurd, therefore, is it either to say, that all taxes fall ultimately
upon land; or as others, for no better reason, pretend, that
they fall upon trade. I say, that this category of taxes which I have
now been describing, and which I shall still more fully explain in a
subsequent chapter, never can either fall upon, or affect any person
but the idle; that is to say, the not industrious consumer. If there be
found a possibility for any consumer to draw back the tax he has paid,
I say he is of the class of the industrious, in one way or other: and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>I farther say, that such a tax raises the price of the commodity. But
by drawing back, I understand, that the repayment is an inseparable
consequence of his having paid the tax. I do not, for example,
say that a place-man draws back his taxes by the emoluments of
his office: but I say a brewer draws back his excise by the sale of
his beer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let this principle also be retained, that with respect to the consumption
of superfluities by the manufacturing classes, they must
be considered as being of the class of the rich and idle, as much as
the first Duke in England. When therefore the extravagance of the
manufacturing classes becomes general, and when the rate of the
market can afford them great wages, relatively to the price of necessaries,
such profits consolidate into the price of the manufacture,
according to the principles laid down in the 10th chapter of the
second book. The statesman then must endeavour to create a competition,
by introducing fresh and untainted hands into such
branches. This will be a sure check upon the industrious, and, if
rightly applied, will prevent all frauds, all pretences for the rise of
the price of labour on account of taxes: and, if carried to the full
extent, will prevent any industrious person from enjoying either
a day’s idleness, or the smallest superfluity; except in consequence
of his peculiar dexterity, or extrinsic advantages.</p>

<h3 id='ch5.4' class='c013'>CHAP. IV. <br /> <i>Of cumulative Taxes.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>I shall not repeat what I have already said concerning
the characteristics of this kind of imposition; but after citing
some examples, I shall examine it more closely, as to its nature
and consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>The most familiar examples of it to an Englishman, are tithes,
land-tax, window-tax, and poors-rates.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most familiar examples to a Frenchman, are the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Taille</i></span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Fourage</i></span>,
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Ustencil</i></span>, (which go commonly together) also the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Capitation</i></span>, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Dixieme</i></span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Vingtieme</i></span>, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Industrie</i></span><a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Taille</i></span> is properly a land-tax, to which men called <em>noble</em> are not subjected.
The reason of which is, that it was originally imposed in lieu of such personal military
services as were peculiar to the lower classes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Fourage</i></span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Ustencil</i></span> are laid upon all those who pay the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>, and are in proportion
to it. The first is appropriated for the subsistence of the cavalry, when they are
in quarters; the last for kettles and small utensils for the infantry.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Capitation</i></span> is the poll-tax. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Dixiemes</i></span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Vingtiemes</i></span> have been already
explained, and tithes are well known to every one.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Industrie</i></span> is that imposition arbitrarily laid on by the Intendants of provinces,
upon all classes of industrious people, in proportion to their supposed profits in every
branch of business.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The nature of all these taxes, is, to affect the possessions, income
and profits of every individual, without putting it in their power
to draw them back in any way whatever; consequently, such taxes
tend very little towards enhancing the price of commodities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who come under such taxes, do not always consider that
their past industry, gains, or advantages of fortune, are here intended
to suffer a diminution, in favour of the state; for which outgoing
they have, perhaps, made no provision.</p>

<p class='c001'>When people of the lower classes, instead of being subjected to
proportional taxes, are laid under such impositions, there results a
great inconvenience. They are allowed to receive the whole profit
of their industry, which in the former chapter we called their (B),
the state however reserving to itself a claim for a part of it: this, instead
of being paid gradually, as in a proportional tax, is collected
at the end of the year, when they have made no provision for it,
and consequently, they are put to distress.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, how hard is it to deprive them of the power of drawing
back what they pay? And how ill judged to trust money with those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>who are supposed only to gain an easy physical-necessary? An
equivalent for procuring the articles of ease and luxury, should
not be left in the hands of those who are not permitted to enjoy
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we may conclude, 1. That the more such taxes are
proportional to the subject taxed, 2. the more evident that proportion
appears; and 3. the more frequently and regularly they are
levied, the more they will resemble proportional taxes, and the less
burden will be found in paying them. Let me illustrate this by
some examples.</p>

<p class='c001'>The stoppage upon a soldier’s pay, either for the invalids, or
Chelsea, is a cumulative tax; but the method of levying it gives
it all the advantages of one of the proportional kind. 1st, It bears
an exact and determinate proportion to the value of his pay.
2<i>dly</i>, This proportion he knows perfectly. And 3<i>tio</i>, Instead of
receiving the whole into his own possession, and paying the hospital
at the end of the year, it is regularly and gradually retained
from him at every payment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tithes are a cumulative tax; but they are accompanied with all
the three requisites to make them light; although in other respects
they are excessively burdensome. 1<i>st</i>, They bear an exact
proportion to the crop. 2<i>dly</i>, This proportion is perfectly known.
3<i>dly</i>, Nature, and not the labourer, makes the provision. But
they fall upon an improper object: they affect the whole produce
of the land, and not the surplus; which last is the only fund that
ought to be taxed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The land-tax in Scotland bears, 1<i>st</i>, a very determinate proportion
to the valuation of the land; and has, 2<i>dly</i>, the advantage of
being well known to every contributor; so that provision may easily
be made for it. But the third requisite is wanting: the proprietor
having the public money in his hands, often applies it to private
purposes; and when the demand is made upon him, he is put to
distress.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>, in many provinces of France, bears, first, a very exact
proportion to the value of the land<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. This sort of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span> is called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tariffée</i></span>; because it is imposed according to a valuation
of the land. It is a late improvement; but still is exposed to numberless inconveniences,
which are mentioned in the text.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But in the second place, the proportion is entirely unknown to
the man who pays it; being nowhere to be seen but in the offices
of the intendant and his deputies.</p>

<p class='c001'>And in the last place, the whole payment comes at once.</p>

<p class='c001'>What hides, and consequently destroys this proportion, is, that
after the distribution is laid on, as in Scotland, at so many shillings
in the pound of valuation, the full sum intended to be raised does
not come in; either because the intendant has given exemptions to
certain parishes, on account of the accidents of sterility, hail, mortality
among the cattle, and the like; or because the property of a
part of the parish has fallen into the hands of people exempted
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>; or that others, who were really bound to pay part
of it, are become insolvent. The intendant must then make a
second, and perhaps a third general distribution of the deficiency
upon all the contributors, in the most exact proportion to the first,
but yet by their nature impossible to be foreseen. It is for these
reasons chiefly that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span> in that kingdom is so grievous.</p>

<p class='c001'>These second distributions of the tax, 1<i>st</i>, destroy the proportion
between the tax and the revenue taxed. <i>2dly</i>, They make it impossible
to judge of the amount of them. And lastly, the demand
comes at once, when, perhaps, the money has been otherwise applied.</p>

<p class='c001'>The French tax upon industry is more grievous still; because
none of the three requisites above-mentioned are allowed to
operate.</p>

<p class='c001'>This tax is supposed to be proportional to the profits made upon
trade, and other branches of industry, not having the land for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>their object. All merchants and tradesmen, in cities, and in the
country, pay the tax called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Industrie</i></span>; and the reason given for establishing
this tax, as I have said in another place, is in order to
make every individual in the state contribute to the expence of it,
in proportion to the advantages he reaps. Nothing would be more
just, could it be put in execution, without doing more hurt to the
state, than the revenue drawn from it can do good.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now shew how, in this tax, all the three requisites we
have mentioned are wanting.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, By its nature, it can bear no exact proportion to the profits
of the industrious man; since nobody but the person taxed can so
much as guess at their extent.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, It cannot possibly be provided for, as no check can be put
upon the imposer, unless so far as general rules are laid down for
each class of the industrious; and from these again other inconveniences
flow, as shall be observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, It comes at once upon poor people, who have been frequently
forced to beg for want of employment before the tax-gatherer
could make his demand; and those who remain, frequently
become beggars before they can comply with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I say, that from the general rules laid down for regulating this
tax, as to every class, a workman who has a large family to maintain,
is no less taxed than one who has no charge but himself: and
it will be allowed, I believe, that the profits of one industrious
person of the lower classes, is in no country sufficient to pay any
considerable tax, and maintain a large family, much less a sickly
one. I therefore imagine, that cumulative taxes never should be
raised upon such classes of inhabitants as have no income but their
personal industry, which is so frequently precarious.</p>

<p class='c001'>Merchants also ought not to be subjected to any tax upon their
industry. They ought to be allowed to accumulate riches as fast
as they can: because they employ them for the advancement of
industry; and every deduction from their profits is a diminution
upon that so useful fund.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>When cumulative taxes are laid upon any of the industrious
classes, they tend to check growing wealth; and are most familiarly
imposed in monarchical states, where riches are apt to excite
jealousy, as has been observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as to the class of land proprietors, that is to say, the more
wealthy inhabitants, who live upon a revenue already made, the
impropriety of cumulative taxes is much less. They are however
burdensome, and disagreeable in all cases, and ought to be dispensed
with, when the necessary supplies can be made out by proportional
taxes, without raising the prices of labour too high for
the prosperity of foreign trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the examples I have given of this branch of taxation, I
hope the nature of it may be fully understood, and that for the
future no inconvenience will arise from my employing the term
of <em>cumulative tax</em>. I shall now subjoin its definition.</p>

<p class='c001'>A <em>cumulative tax</em>, is <em>the accumulation of that return which every individual,
who enjoys any superfluity, owes daily to the state, for the advantages
he receives by living in the society</em>. As this definition would not have
been understood at setting out, I thought it proper, first, to explain
the nature of the thing to be defined.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h3 id='ch5.5' class='c013'>CHAP. V. <br /> <i>Of the Inconveniences which proceed from proportional Taxes, and of the Methods of removing them.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>A proportional tax, as I have said, is that which is
levied upon the idle consumer, at the time he buys the
commodity; and while, by consuming it, the balance of wealth
is turning against him, in favour of the seller. This tax is consolidated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>as it were with the price of the commodity, and must of
necessity raise it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I say, it is levied at the time of buying, and affects the buyer,
in consequence of his consumption; because we have seen, that
when the commodity is not consumed by the purchaser, then upon
a subsequent alienation he is refunded all he paid. I consider
him therefore, in that case, not as <em>paying</em>, but as <em>advancing</em> it for
another; and while any part of the commodity remains unconsumed,
there still remains the equivalent of a proportional part
of the tax in the hands of him who advanced it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now proceed, as in the former chapter, by giving some
examples of such impositions; and in examining them, endeavour
to shew their nature and consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most familiar to an Englishman are, <em>excises</em>, <em>customs</em>, <em>malt-tax</em>,
<em>stamp-duties</em>, and the like.</p>

<p class='c001'>To a Frenchman the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>gabelle</i></span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>traittes</i></span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>aides</i></span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tobacco</i></span>, &amp;c.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>gabelle</i></span> is a branch of the general farms, and consists of an excise upon salt.
The manufacture of the commodity is in the hands of the farmers; and they, for a
liberty to sell salt at a certain price, far above the expence of the manufacture, pay to
the King an annual revenue of 28 millions of livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>This I call a proportional tax, relatively to consumers; although in reality no tax-gatherers
are employed for the collection of it, contrary to what is the case of all excises;
which are never farmed by government to the manufacturers of the commodity
taxed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>traittes</i></span>, or, as they are otherwise called, the five great farms, were established
by Colbert, when he took away a multitude of customs paid upon the transportation
of goods from one province to another. They answer very much to our customs, or
to the duties of tunnage and poundage, and are let to the farmers general for the sum
of 12 millions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tobacco</i></span> is of the same nature with the salt tax. The farmers general have the
exclusive privilege of selling it at a price fixed by the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the farm of the tobacco is paid 15 millions.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>aides</i></span> resemble our excises more than those we have mentioned. They consist
in duties upon liquors, either brought into towns, or sold by retail in public houses;
and upon all articles of food sold in corporations, except grain of every kind, which
is free. They comprehend also a multitude of other duties superfluous to enumerate.
They are collected by tax-gatherers at the gates of every town, who also have access
to all public houses, where retail is laid under additional rates. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>aides</i></span> are farmed
at 38 600 000 livres. These were the rates in the farms let in 1755. They have
been since augmented in 1762, as has been observed.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In all kinds of this imposition we find the tax regularly reimbursed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>from hand to hand; it adheres so closely to the commodity,
that it becomes as essentially a part of the value, as carriage, packing,
and the like incident charges, enter into the prices of goods.
It never can affect the industrious person who does not consume;
and never can be avoided by him who does. Such taxes therefore
necessarily raise the price of the commodity taxed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having already pointed out the principal advantages of proportional
taxes, which is to throw the whole of the burden upon the
rich, whom we have called the idle consumers, the better to distinguish
them from the opulent class of the industrious; I must now
enumerate the principal inconveniences complained of, from this
mode of taxation, and trace out the principles from which they
may be ascertained and removed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principal inconveniences alledged against proportional taxes
may be reduced to three:</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, That they have the effect of raising the price of labour, and
the produce of industry, and thereby prove hurtful to the prosperity
of foreign trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, That they discourage consumption, by carrying the prices
of many things too high for people of a middling rank in life.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, That they are both expensive in the collection, and oppressive,
from the many restrictions put upon liberty, in order to prevent
frauds.</p>

<p class='c001'>In analyzing every one of these inconveniences, it will be proper
to inquire, how far the conclusions against those taxes are drawn
from matter of fact; how far from plausible appearances only;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>and so far as they are real, not imaginary, to discover the methods
of removing them.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the first inconvenience lies in raising the price of all kinds of
labour, and consequently of manufactures, I must distinguish between
the consequence of raising prices at home, and of raising
them upon articles of exportation; and I must consider the one
and the other relatively to the collective body of a state, and not to
some few individuals in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>High prices at home are no discouragement to the industrious,
most certainly, however disagreeable they may prove to consumers;
and while they stand high, it is a proof that the demand of the
consumers does not diminish.</p>

<p class='c001'>High prices upon goods to be exported, are to be judged of by
the proportion they bear to those in other countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the price of a manufacturer’s wages is not regulated by
the price of his subsistence, but by the price at which his manufacture
sells in the market. Could a weaver, for example, live
upon the air, he would still sell his day’s work according to the
value of the manufacture produced by it, when brought to market.
As long as he can prevent the effects of the competition of
his neighbours, he will carry the price of his work as high as is
consistent with the profits of the merchant, who buys it from him
in order to bring it to market; and this he will continue to do,
until the rate of the market is brought down.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is therefore the rate of the market for labour and manufactures,
and not the price of subsistence, which determines the
standard of wages. Were proportional taxes to raise the price of
subsistence, and by that circumstance to discourage manufactures,
we should see the generality of workmen living with sobriety,
depriving themselves of superfluity, confining themselves to the
plain but sufficient physical-necessary, working with all the assiduity
that a man can support, and still not able to supply the market
at the ordinary rates.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>When in any country the work of manufacturers, who live
luxuriously, and who can afford to be idle some days of the week,
and still live upon their wages, finds a ready market, this circumstance
alone proves beyond all dispute, that subsistence in that
country is not too dear, at least in proportion to the market prices
at home; and if taxes on consumption have, in fact, raised the
price of necessaries, beyond the former standard, this rise cannot,
in fact, discourage industry: it may discourage idleness; and idleness
will not be totally rooted out, until people be forced, in one
way or other, to give up both superfluity and days of recreation.</p>

<p class='c001'>People are very apt to draw conclusions from what they think
ought to be, according to the particular combinations they form
to themselves; and for this reason it is generally thought, because
taxes are higher in England than in some other countries, that
foreign trade should therefore be hurt by them. But the sloth and
idleness of man, and the want of ambition in the lower classes to
improve their circumstances, tends more, I suspect, to circumscribe
the productions of industry, and thus to raise their price,
than any tax upon subsistence which has been hitherto imposed in
that kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole of this doctrine is proved by experience, and is confirmed
by our natural feelings. Many have been amazed to see how
well the manufacturing classes live in years of scarcity, which
frequently have the effect of doubling the price of the most necessary
articles of subsistence. Are they not found, in bad years,
more assiduous in their labour? Do they then frequent ale-houses,
as in the years of plenty? Are they found idle one half of the
week? Why should a tax laid on by the hand of nature prove
such a spur to industry; and another, similar to it in its effect, laid
on by the hand of man, produce such hurtful consequences?
Were a tract of bad years, I dare not say an increase of taxes, to
continue long enough to bring manufacturers to a habit of sobriety
and application, a return of plenty, and low prices, would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>throw into their coffers, what many of them dissipate in riot and
prodigality.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even this conclusion will be too general, if every combination be
taken in. Manufacturers there are, who work hard, and live soberly
six days of the week, and who at the end find little superfluity,
notwithstanding the high price of labour. Alas! they
have many mouths to feed, and only two hands to supply the necessaries.
This is the fatal competition so much insisted on in the
first book, and by which a door is opened to great distress. Either
the unmarried gain what the married should, and become extravagant,
or the married gain no more than the unmarried can do,
and become miserable.</p>

<p class='c001'>The average between the two ought to determine the rate of
wages in every modern society.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remedies for this unequal competition, flowing from the
happy liberty we enjoy, have been considered in another place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The inconvenience here under examination will not be removed
by an abolition of taxes; nor will it increase by the augmentation
of them, as long as manufacturers, upon an average, enjoy superfluity
and idle days.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under these circumstances I conclude, that if foreign trade
suffers by the high prices of commodities in our markets, the
vice does not proceed from our taxes, but from our domestic
luxury, which swells demand at home. Were we less luxurious,
and more frugal in our management in general, all classes of the
industrious, from the retailer down to the lowest manufacturer,
would be satisfied with more moderate profits. Let not, therefore,
a statesman regulate his conduct upon suppositions, nor
conclude any thing from theory, nor from arguments <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>à priori</i></span>,
drawn from the supposed effects of taxes; but let him have recourse
to information and experience concerning the real state of
the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let him inquire what are the prices abroad; what are the prices
at home; how those who work in exportable commodities live;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>what superfluities they enjoy; and what days of idleness they indulge
in.</p>

<p class='c001'>If he finds that goods are not exported, because of high prices,
while manufacturers are enjoying superfluity, and indulging themselves
in idleness, let him multiply hands, and he will reduce
them all to their physical-necessary; and by thus augmenting the
supply, he will also reduce the prices in his markets at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>If he wants to reduce prices still lower, in favour of exportation,
but finds that he has occasion for the amount of certain taxes,
which enhance the value of this physical-necessary, to which he
has reduced his industrious classes, then let him grant a bounty
upon the quantity exported, more than equivalent to all the taxes
paid by those who provide it; and let the people at home continue to
pay dearer than strangers, in favour of the state. If you only want
to promote exportation by lowering prices, there will be no occasion
to lower them universally, any more than there is occasion to put
a large plaister over the whole body, to cure a small pimple on
a particular part of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said, that while the rate of the market remains the same,
so will the prices of every part of labour and industry, which
enters into the composition of the thing brought to market. This
is consistent with reason, and experience proves the truth of it;
because we do not see wages fluctuate with the price of living. If
they do not fluctuate in that proportion, how can we conclude that
a rise in the price of subsistence, occasioned by taxes, should raise
wages more than when the price is raised by a natural scarcity. It
may be answered, that the imposition of a tax gives a general
alarm; the effect it must have upon prices is immediately felt;
and manufacturers then insist upon an augmentation: whereas,
when nature either produces the same, or even a greater effect,
people submit to what they think comes from the hand of God,
and content themselves with the hopes of better times. I shall
allow this argument all its force. But I must observe, that when
manufacturers can thus capitulate with their employers, and insist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>upon an augmentation of their wages, the demand of the market
must be greater than the supply from their work. This is the circumstance
which raises the price of labour. Let the demand of
the market fall, the prices of labour will fall, in spite of all the
reasons which ought naturally to make them rise. The workmen
will then enter into a hurtful competition, and starve one another,
as has been often observed. Let the demand of the market rise,
manufacturers may raise their wages in proportion to the rise of
the market; they may, in the cheapest years, enjoy the highest
wages; drink one half of the week, and laugh at their employer,
when he expects they should work for less, in order to swell his
profits in the rising market.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have endeavoured to throw this question into different shapes,
the better to apply different principles to it; and upon the whole,
I must determine that proportional taxes will,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Undoubtedly raise the price of every commodity upon
which they are properly and immediately imposed; and if they
be laid upon bread, and other articles of nourishment, they will
directly raise the price of these articles in proportion; but the
price of labour will be raised consequentially only, and according
to circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>That if taxes be laid upon the day’s labour of a man, they will
raise the price of that day’s labour. What I mean by this, is, that
if every one who employs a man for a day, were obliged to pay
a penny to the state, for a permission to employ him, the employer
would charge a penny more at least upon the day’s work performed
by the labourer. Were a tax equivalent to it laid on the labourer
by the year, it would be of a cumulative and arbitrary nature,
and would not raise the price of his wages in proportion; but
were it laid upon the workman at a penny a day, and levied daily,
in this case, he might raise his wages in proportion. But this is
not the practice any where.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The price of subsistence, whether it be influenced or not by
the imposition of taxes, does not determine the price of labour.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>This is regulated by the demand for the work, and the competition
among the workmen to be employed in producing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, If wages rise beyond the physical-necessary of the workman,
they may be brought down by multiplying hands, but never
by lowering the price of necessaries; because every man will
make a profit of the low price, but will regulate his gain by the
rate of demand for his labour.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, If, therefore, the price of his physical-necessary be raised
upon him by the effect of taxes, he must work the harder to make
it up.</p>

<p class='c001'>5<i>to</i>, If hands increase, after he is reduced to his physical-necessary,
the whole class of the manufacturers will be forced to
starve.</p>

<p class='c001'>6<i>to</i>, The increase of hands means no more than the augmentation
of the quantity of work produced. If, therefore, the same
hands work more than formerly, it is the same thing as if their
numbers were increased.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these positions it seems to result, that whenever it is found
that manufacturers enjoy wages more than in proportion to their
physical-necessary through the year, reckoned upon the general
average of married men and batchelors, the method of reducing
them to the proper standard, is either to multiply hands, if you
want to reduce prices in your own market, or to augment the
price of their physical-necessary, if you incline they should remain
the same. When the hands employed are really diligent, and
prices still too high, then it may be expedient to increase their
numbers, providing they enjoy considerable profits. This will cut
them off, and reduce the price of commodities; because it will
augment the supply.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the hands employed are not diligent, the first expedient is
to raise the price of their subsistence, by taxing it. By this you
never will raise their wages, until the market can afford to give a
better price for their work. If, when they are brought to be fully
employed, you incline to sink the price of labour universally, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>must take off some of the impositions which affect subsistence, and
at the same time gradually throw in fresh hands, in order to promote
competition, which alone will force them to lower their
prices in proportion. The whole delicacy of this operation is to
prevent competition from taking place after the industrious are reduced
to moderate profits; and to promote competition, or to raise
the price of their subsistence, until they be brought to the proper
standard. Having insisted so fully upon these principles in the
xviiith chapter of the second book, I here refer to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>1 have said, that the price of work is not regulated by the price
of subsistence, but by the price of the market for the work. Now
I say, that the price of the market may in a great measure be influenced
by the price of subsistence. This is a new combination.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first proposition is undeniable. The price of the market at
all times <em>regulates</em> the price of work; because it regularly makes it
fluctuate, in proportion to its own fluctuations. The price, again,
of subsistence only <em>influences</em> it; because two circumstances may
destroy that influence. A high demand for work will raise the
price of wages in years of plenty: a low demand will sink the
price of wages in years of scarcity. When therefore it is said,
that the price of subsistence <em>influences</em> the rate of markets, we only
mean, that the average price of subsistence, when good and bad
years are taken together, have a certain influence in regulating
prices. But this average price of subsistence cannot every where
<em>regulate</em> the value of work, as the average price of a ship’s cargo
can regulate the price of every part of it; because the variations
there are at too great a distance of time, to be able to compensate
one another with respect to all the manufacturing classes of a
people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could a plan be concerted, either to preserve the price of grain
at one uniform standard, or within the limits of 15 or perhaps 20
<i>per cent.</i> at all times; and were this to be executed by the assistance
of a tax at one time, and a bounty as it were at another; it would
certainly have an admirable effect in every industrious nation. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>would in a manner take away the difference between good and bad
years. The industrious finding themselves subsisted at all times
nearly at the same expence, would not feel those alternate motives
to be idle and extravagant at one time, and diligent and sober at
another.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have enlarged so much upon the nature of this first inconvenience
proceeding from proportional taxes, that I have left myself
very little to say as to the second, which is,</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, That they discourage consumption, by raising prices too high
for people of a middling rank in life.</p>

<p class='c001'>In answer to this, I must observe, that all the amount of proportional
taxes is refunded to the industrious consumer, so far as they
are raised on articles <em>necessary</em> for his subsistence; and when he is
either idle, or consumes a superfluity, he is classed along with the
idle and rich. Now if the rate of market prices be high, relatively
to the income of certain individuals, it can only be because the
supply of the things they want to consume is not above the proportion
of the demand of those who are richer.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, the rate of the market affords such profits to manufacturers
as to render them idle and luxurious, how can the
augmentation of these profits, by the abolition of taxes, and consequent
diminution of the price of subsistence, ever diminish the
competition of the rich, unless the supply be augmented?</p>

<p class='c001'>But if the high prices of our own markets cut off the demand of
strangers, then every principle laid down in the 10th and 18th chapters
of the second book, must be applied to bring them down: and
so far as taxes, which are imposed either to supply the exigencies
of the state, or to cut off consolidated profits, enjoyed by manufacturers
in consequence of our own extravagance, have contributed
either to raise them, or to support them when raised, above the
foreign standard, a full equivalent, in the way of bounty, must be
given for them, in order to bring the exportation price of goods
below the level of foreign competition.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>I come now to the last inconvenience alleged against proportional
taxes, to wit, the expence of collecting them, and the oppression
which is a consequence of the many restrictions laid upon liberty,
in order to prevent frauds.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the expence of collection, it is entirely in proportion to the
disposition of the people to defraud the public.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France, the collecting the branches of cumulative taxes, such
as the general receipts, comprehending the taille, poll-tax, &amp;c.
costs the state no less than 10 <i>per cent.</i> or two sols in the livre, which
is superadded to those impositions, in order to defray that expence.
Whereas in England the expence of collecting the excise, administred
by commissioners, who act for the public, not by farmers who
act for themselves, does not cost above 5<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in the 100<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>This matter of fact is sufficient to prove, that excises, when under
a proper administration, are not so very expensive in the collection
as is generally imagined; and they would still be attended with
less expence, were some proper alterations made in the present method
of imposing them. This will appear as we go along.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>oppression</em> of levying excises does not, in any proportion, so
much affect those who really <em>pay</em> them, as those who only advance
them for the consumers.</p>

<p class='c001'>This distinction which we have already made, will appear well
founded, upon examining the complaints which are commonly
made against the collectors of this duty.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen that in the taxes upon salt and tobacco in France,
there are no duties collected upon the people; the farmers of the
salt have all the salt marshes and salt pits assigned to them by the
King; no person, not privileged, is allowed to make salt for the
consumption of those provinces which are subjected to the Gabelle.</p>

<p class='c001'>In like manner the distribution and sale of tobacco is exclusively
in the hands of the farmers: they buy it either from Great Britain,
or from the Dutch at second hand; they manufacture it themselves,
and sell it over all France, at the price set upon it by the King; and
we saw, that during the last war, they paid thirty millions down
for a permission to raise the price of it 10 <i>per cent.</i> during ten years.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>This price fixed upon the sale of tobacco, answers exactly to what
we know under the name of assize, which ought constantly to
attend all excises<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a>: for want of observing exactly that regulation,
the publicans and victuallers in England raised the price of their
strong beer one halfpenny <i>per</i> quart, in consequence of an additional
duty of three shillings <i>per</i> barrel imposed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anno</i></span> 1761, which
is at the rate only of one farthing <i>per</i> quart<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f42'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r42'>42</a>. When excises are imposed upon any commodity, it is contrary to all principles in
fixing the assize, not to superadd the whole duty imposed to the former selling price.
This however is sometimes omitted, with an intention to make part of the duty fall
upon the manufacturer, to the ease of the subject. The consequences are,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The manufacturers blow up the spirit of the people against the tax, who never
would think of making an outcry, were they not excited to it by the interested motives of
the manufacturers. Were high profits allowed on imposing the tax, manufacturers would
be quiet: and if the profits were afterwards found to be too high, it would then be a
popular measure to reduce the selling price, and also a means of setting people on the
side of government, against the manufacturers, who are their real tax-gatherers.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, It is impossible to compass the end proposed. A proportional tax, rightly
imposed, must be drawn back; and all attempts to prevent it, only occasion a multiplication
of frauds, and a bad manufacture.</p>

<p class='c001'>In fixing assizes upon the manufacture of goods, which in different years vary in
their price, regard should be had to such variations; otherwise the manufacturer is
distressed, and the public is ill served: and the one or the other happening, the people
are animated against such duties.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only expedient to share the profits of the manufacturers of exciseable commodities,
is to lay them under some cumulative tax which they cannot draw back, such
as making them pay for a licence.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. It must, however, be observed, that the price of beer was not raised, either by the
brewers, or by the victuallers, on account of the additional malt-duty, <i>anno</i> 1760.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When the sale of an exciseable commodity is vested in a company
who manufacture it, by exclusive privilege, the whole oppression
of collection is avoided; because the company itself then pays
the duty, and they draw their reimbursement from proportional
profits on the sale of the goods.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the greatest advantage of the farm above the public management
of a tax.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>When excises are levied upon those who manufacture the commodity
excised, the oppression of the laws falls upon the manufacturers,
although they only advance the tax, and draw it back from
the consumers upon the sale of the commodity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is greatly for the advantage of every consumer in the kingdom,
that no fraud in the collections should pass unobserved; because
all the profits arising from frauds belong to the manufacturer,
who in reality is the tax-gatherer, as much as the farmers in France,
when they sell their salt and tobacco. But as the farmers appear in
the light of King’s officers, and that the collectors seem to bear hard
on those with whom they live, people foolishly imagine, that were
brewers, for example, more gently dealt with, beer would come the
cheaper to themselves. This is a mere delusion; because no brewer
whatever will sell his beer cheaper than either an assize, or the ordinary
rate obliges him to do, let his profit, from frauds, be ever so great,
and his address in committing them ever so successful; and the less
productive the tax turns out to be, the more the other impositions upon
the people must be augmented, in order to make up the deficiency.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we compare therefore the oppression of excise-laws felt by those
who only <em>advance</em> these impositions, with the ease which the consumers
find who really <em>pay</em> them, we may judge of the advantages
which the proportional taxes have over the cumulative.</p>

<p class='c001'>The excise, as paid by the brewer, is really of the cumulative
kind. The exciseman demands money of him, at a time when no
alienation takes place, and perhaps when he is not prepared to make
the advance for his customers, who must refund it to him with
profit: besides the hopes of being able to defraud is disappointed,
and it is always disagreeable to be disappointed in what we either
wish or hope.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were all mankind honest, the inconveniences of levying such
taxes would be less; but as that is not the case, methods must be
fallen upon to disappoint the intention of committing fraud. The
only way to accomplish this, is, to render it difficult and dangerous.
While every individual has a liberty to manufacture an exciseable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>commodity in whatever place he thinks fit to enter for that purpose,
when every one has a liberty to sell liquors, which, upon
retail only, are subjected to excise (as is the case in France) must
not collectors be multiplied in proportion to the occupation which
such policy implies? And will not these collectors oppose frauds to
frauds, in order to profit by them, at the expence of the merchant
or manufacturer? This will sow discord and hatred between two
classes of the same society, and thereby the state is hurt. All discord
hurts a state, as it does a private family.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is out of my way to lay down plans for preventing such inconveniences.
It would require an intimate knowledge of every circumstance
relating to the country for which the remedy is intended.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall therefore endeavour only to throw out some useful hints,
by mentioning the impositions where the inconveniences in levying
are the least; and by comparing these with other impositions, where
the oppression in levying appears to be greater, the contrast of circumstances
will suggest the principles upon which a plan might be
formed.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are many more frauds and difficulties in collecting excises
in the country than in cities, from the number of manufacturers
employed in them. It is just so with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>aides</i></span> in France, from the
number of retailers. There are very few frauds and little difficulty
in gathering the malt-tax; because the object is unwieldy, and
the places of manufacture are fewer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The frauds upon tobacco and salt in France, do not proceed from
those who manufacture them, but from those who introduce
foreign goods to supply the place of those manufactured by the
company. This shews that excises should be made as general as
possible over a country; because local exemptions introduce, as it
were, a foreign country into the center of a state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Stamp-duties are seldom defrauded by forging the stamp; but in
France, where they extend to almost every <em>deed</em> of alienation, the
public is defrauded by private bargains.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>Customs are defrauded by the liberty given to trade in every port;
and from the want of convenient public magazines, as a proper
repository for all goods brought by sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be said, in general, that frauds are most frequent upon
the new establishment of taxes; that those who complain most of
the oppression of them, are precisely those who have the least reason
for it; and that the cause of their complaint proceeds
rather from the inconvenience in paying when they are not prepared,
and the disappointment in defrauding, than from any
real oppression arising from the laws of excise: the hardships of these
laws are owing to the necessity of general rules to prevent frauds;
and such rules would be unnecessary, could the liberty of committing
frauds be circumscribed.</p>

<p class='c001'>One very good method of raising proportional taxes, without
great expence or oppression, when the situation of a country will
admit of it, is to levy no such duties, but at the gates of towns and
villages, which in this light appear to be political inclosures. At
those gates every produce of the lands, and every manufacture not
made in the town, might pay a tax upon coming in; every manufacture
made in the town, might pay a tax on going out: all fruits consumed
in the country might be free; all manufactures made and
consumed in the towns might be free also. If we consider the quantity
of exchange between the inhabitants of towns and those of the
country, and between town and town; that fund, I believe, would
be found sufficient to raise more by proportional taxes than what is
raised in any country in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>A second method of diminishing the expence, and also the burden
of proportional taxes, is to exact nothing of the manufacturers,
but to prohibit the delivery of the manufacture to any one who does
not present a permit from the excise office, signifying that the tax
has been paid. This is the method observed in the Austrian low
countries, where excises are carried to a very great height. There
the transporters or carriers of exciseable goods, are formed into a
corporation, and none else dare to transport them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>Whoever has seen the execution of those regulations will not be
very fond of them; but the inconveniences which occur proceed
from the political situation of all those towns, the public debts of
which are so enormous, that to pay the interest of them excises have
been carried so high as to banish manufacturers into the country,
where few excises are levied. It is from the country and many considerable
villages, which have not the privilege of running in debt,
that the manufactures of that country are carried on. No industrious
man can afford to live in the towns of the Austrian Netherlands,
except he who supplies their consumption; and in no place,
I know of, is work so dear as there.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were great excises levied upon the furnishers of the goods, as is
the case in Great Britain, and were as little restraint laid upon their
frauds, those duties would not produce what they do; and the
oppression would be intolerable; whereas by the policy established,
nothing but the high price of goods is complained of. A third method
of avoiding both expence and oppression in levying proportional
taxes, would be to confine the fabrication of all articles
charged with them to certain places properly inclosed. Were those
undertakings few and large, were spacious magazines of all sorts
prepared, at the public expence, in all sea-port towns, and surrounded
with walls, an entire liberty might be allowed within the
inclosures, and no questions would be asked, but on going in and
coming out. Under such regulations a state would reap great benefit.
1<i>st</i>, There would be considerable savings in collecting. 2<i>dly</i>,
There would be great savings on the number of hands employed in
manufacturing: forty men, in a large brew-house, make more beer
than an hundred disposed as they are in country villages. This
resembles the introduction of machines into manufactures.</p>

<p class='c001'>The objection from the infringement of liberty is more a pretext,
in order to facilitate fraud, than any thing else. Are not those
who manufacture exciseable commodities, the servants of the state?
Are they not even the collectors of the public revenue? With what
face then can they pretend to be indulged in the means of defrauding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>their customers of those taxes which they wish to put into their
own pockets, by withholding them from the public. Has liberty
any other meaning, but an entire permission to do whatever is not
forbid by general and wholesome laws, calculated for the universal
good of the society; and shall this class of men, who are enriching
themselves as much by the profits they have in advancing the taxes,
as by their industry, be considered in as favourable a light as another
who is paying a cumulative tax out of his income, one farthing
of which he never can draw back?</p>

<p class='c001'>If any should misinterpret the doctrine of this chapter, I
must put them in mind of my original plan, which was to
keep constantly in view those virtuous statesmen who think of
nothing but the good of their subjects. Taxes and impositions in
their hands, are the wealth of the father of the family; who therewith
feeds, clothes, provides for, and defends every one within his
house. The increase of taxes on this supposition is national oeconomy,
as shall be afterwards shewn; frauds are the thefts of servants
impairing the public good, and particularly the means o£
self-defence against the incroachments of ambitious neighbours.</p>

<p class='c001'>As it is the duty of every statesman to make his people happy
and flourishing, perhaps the speculations of one whose only interest
in throwing them upon paper is to fill up his leisure agreeably,
may some time or other tend to promote so glorious a purpose.</p>

<hr class='c006' />
<h3 id='ch5.6' class='c013'>CHAP. VI. <br /> <i>Cumulative and proportional Taxes compared with one another, and farther examined.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>After examining separately the nature and effects of cumulative
and proportional taxes, it remains, for the more fully
understanding this subject, to take a view of them together; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>better to find out wherein they really differ, and how far the difference
is only apparent.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been observed, that the payment of taxes diminishes no
part of the produce of either land, or industry; the whole amount
of these remains entire to the subjects of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>The taxes are paid out of the money which circulates in the
alienation of them: from which we have concluded that they must
constantly be confined within a certain proportion to alienation.
We have also observed, that the imposition of taxes augments the
mass of circulation, and makes it requisite for a statesman to contrive
some method of increasing money in proportion to their increase.
I hope these propositions have acquired an additional confirmation,
from what has been already said in the preceeding
chapters.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have also seen how the amount of proportional taxes is ultimately
taken from the superfluity of the rich, whom we have called
the idle consumers: and how they are advanced by one set of the
industrious, and refunded by another, until at last they fall upon
those who cannot draw them back from any body. These last have
been said to <em>pay</em> the taxes, the others only to <em>advance</em> them.</p>

<p class='c001'>If therefore we suppose all desire of defrauding out of the way,
we shall find the whole burden of proportional taxes confined to the
inconvenience of advancing their amount by the industrious,
and to the payment of them by the rich, which proportionally
diminishes their income. Where credit therefore is well established,
where payments are regularly made by buyers to sellers, and
where people proportion their expence to their free income, the
weight of proportional taxes will be very small. I appeal to experience
for the truth of this.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next examine the nature of cumulative taxes, as we have
called them, in order to distinguish them from the others.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these, alienation is not necessary at the time they are paid; from
which it follows, that, in many cases, they cannot be drawn back.
When a man pays his land-tax out of his rent, what remains to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>will not buy more of any thing than if he had paid nothing. Nay,
were the state to indulge him and take his tax in corn, the corn
which remains to him would not bear an advanced price, unless
the state should export the quantity he had given; and then indeed,
by diminishing the supply, it might raise the price of grain in general;
but every one having grain to sell would profit of the rise
upon the price, as well as the landlord, whose share does not commonly
amount to one third of the crop.</p>

<p class='c001'>But were a tax laid on in so regular a proportion to the value of
any property, as to prevent the proprietor from making use of that
part which the public intends to take from him, those who pay
cumulative taxes would thereby acquire one very great alleviation
of their burden.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said that when a brewer pays the excise, the tax, as to him,
is of the cumulative nature. It is so in a certain degree, no doubt,
as may be seen without farther explanation; but it still so far retains
its own nature as to be easily drawn back from the consumer. But
how can a soldier draw back the tax he pays to Chelsea?</p>

<p class='c001'>From this material distinction between the two impositions, I conclude,
that no objection can lie against proportional taxes, so far as
they affect the industrious; because they draw them compleatly
back: and that great objections lie against cumulative taxes, when
they affect the industrious, because they cannot draw them back;
and consequently, they may affect the physical-necessary of the contributor,
in case no profit should remain to him upon his labour.
On the other hand, I think little objection can be made to cumulative
taxes, when they are imposed upon possessions, which produce
a visible annual revenue, clear to the proprietor. This is the nature
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dixiemes</i></span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>vingtiemes</i></span> in France; where the whole
amount of the person’s income is taken upon proper proof, and
taxed in proportion to it, without any subsidiary or second levy’s
taking place, to make up a determinate sum.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cumulative taxes would also be far less burdensome to the lower
class, could they be levied, so as, first, to preserve the proportion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>them to the actual profits on industry: secondly, to make that proportion
sensible to the people: and in the last place, to <em>retain</em> the
tax, instead of allowing them first to receive it, and afterwards
obliging them to refund it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In proportion as these three requisites do not take place, such
taxes become grievous to all who have no fixed income.</p>

<p class='c001'>To put a tax upon a man’s dwelling house, in proportion to its
windows, or hearths, when the house produces no fixed income to
him, and when he has none independent of it, may take away a
part of his physical-necessary. To put a tax upon him because he
has a head, is more grievous than to put a tax upon his hands, in
proportion to what they daily gain.</p>

<p class='c001'>If cumulative and proportional taxes be compared, with respect
to the different effects they are found to have upon our opinions as
to taxes in general, we find that both of them deceive the contributors,
but in different ways.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the cumulative taxes, the person who pays does not always
perceive the reason of his paying. He imagines that he is taxed
only because it is known that he is able to pay a certain sum.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the proportional, the deceit is of another nature. When a person
buys a consumable commodity, which has paid an excise, he
does not perceive that the price he pays for it comprehends a tax
upon his past gains, in favour of the public; but he concludes the
whole to be necessary, in order to procure what he has an inclination
to consume. An example will make this plain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose a tax laid upon wheel carriages, and that every person
in the state were liable to pay a certain sum in proportion to the
number of carriages he has for his convenience. The tax-gatherer
comes at the end of the year and demands the sum. The person
complains that he is not at liberty to have a coach or a chaise without
paying duty for it; and that while he has occasion for one carriage
only, and has but one pair of horses, he is obliged to pay for
several sets of wheels.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, suppose this cumulative tax were turned into a proportional
one, and that wheels were to pay a stamp-duty, or the like,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>in the hands of the wheelwright. The price would immediately
rise; but this rise would soon become familiar to the man who has
the carriage; and he would then be no more hurt by this additional
expence, than if it had proceeded from some new and expensive
fashion of wheels: in short, wheels would generally begin to bear
an advanced price, and very soon no body would inquire how it
came about, nor once complain of the tax.</p>

<p class='c001'>To set this in another light, the difference between the two impositions
resembles that between long and short accounts, which to
poor people is very great. When the expence of living is insensibly
and universally augmented, by the effect of proportional taxes, then
the industrious man, who enjoys neither superfluity or idleness, may
and can augment the price of his work in proportion. This augmentation
forms then a part of what has been called his (A), which he
draws fully back when he comes to market. But if the same, or
even a less sum be raised upon him by a cumulative tax, it comes
upon him at the end of the year, or at the end of the quarter, and
let him be ever so provident, he cannot draw it back, or raise the
price of his work, because of the unequal competition of other
people of his own class, who, from a variety of circumstances,
cannot all be so equally loaded by the cumulative as by the proportional
taxes. Besides, they may not be so provident as himself,
and may work for subsistence, without making any allowance for
what they are to pay the state at the end of the year. Thus a
double inconvenience ensues. The industrious poor are oppressed
by the tax-gatherers, and the tax is ill levied. In the other case,
the first never see a tax-gatherer, and the money is paid. Besides
these advantages in favour of proportional taxes, there is still
another, that if this tax be improperly laid on, the defect will
manifest itself by checking consumption only; whereas in the
other case, it will be known by the distress of individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the liberty not to consume be taken away, as in the gabelle
in some provinces in France, then the imposition changes its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>nature and becomes a cumulative tax, as may be easily perceived<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>gabelle</i></span>, or salt-tax in France, is not levied in every province; because of
certain privileges of exemption, which some have all along enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>This opens a door to the greatest abuse, by smuggling salt from places where it is
free, into places where the tax is imposed, at many 100 <i>per cent.</i> above the value; and
obliges the King to use great severity upon those who are loaded with this duty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consumption of every family is fixed to a certain quantity; and if it be found
that they have not bought, from the King’s granaries, to the full extent of what is
reckoned necessary for them, it is supposed that the deficiency has been made up from
contraband salt, and the deficiency is exacted.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It has been said, that so far as the three inconveniences of the
cumulative taxes can be prevented, they cease to be oppressive.
From which we see the reason why excises are so easily paid when
those who manufacture the commodities charged with them, are
contented to compound for them. This changes the tax into one
of the cumulative kind; but gives it every requisite to make it
easy. Let me take an example.</p>

<p class='c001'>A brewer who pays excise for all he brews, is exposed to the daily
visit of the excise-man, to whom he pays the duty. Here the
brewer’s imposition participates of several of the inconveniences
attending cumulative taxes. But let me suppose that after a certain
time he finds that 100<i>l.</i> is the annual amount of his excise. If he
makes a composition for it at that rate, he comes under a regular
cumulative composition, with every advantage. He thinks no
more of frauds; he no more grudges what he pays; and becomes
in a manner collector of that imperceptible duty paid by all his
customers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The easy method of transforming those taxes into one another,
shews their resemblance sufficiently, and the differences which we
have pointed out, shew the principles which regulate the proper
manner of imposing them.</p>

  <h3 id='ch5.7' class='c013'>CHAP. VII. <br /> <i>Consequence of Taxes when the amount of them is properly applied.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We have now seen the objects affected by taxes, and the inconveniences
which result to those who are obliged to pay them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It comes next to be examined, whether or not taxes of all kinds
be a great load upon a people, a grievous infringement of their
liberty, a means of bringing many honest and industrious people
to great distress, and a great discouragement to marriage. I answer
without hesitation, that taxes may be, and most commonly are
accompanied with all these and many more inconveniences; but I
must add, that they proceed from the abuse, and not from the
nature of taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>In my inquiries, I have constantly in my eye, how man <em>may</em> be
governed, and never how <em>he is</em> governed. How a righteous and
intelligent statesman may restrain the liberty of individuals, in order
to promote the common good; never how an ignorant and
unrighteous statesman may destroy public liberty, for the sake of
individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Raising money by taxes must always be burdensome, less or
more, to those who pay it; and the advantages resulting from taxes
can only proceed from the right application of the money when
raised.</p>

<p class='c001'>When individuals only make a profit of the inconvenience of
taxes, the public loses, no doubt; because they are paid for the advantage
of the public, not for that of private people. If the money
raised be more beneficially employed by the state, than it would
have been by those who have contributed it, then I say the public
has gained, in consequence of the burden laid upon individuals;
consequently, the statesman has done his duty, both in imposing the
taxes, and in rightly expending them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>Taxes, in this last view, may be considered as a saving out of
every private fortune, in order to procure a public fund to be expended
for the public benefit.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have frequently recourse to the familiar examples of private
oeconomy, in order to make applications from it to the political;
which, however different it may appear, will be found easily deducible
from the same principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me suppose two persons, (A) and (B), living in the same neighbourhood,
of the same rank and fortune, enjoying great superfluity,
but spending yearly the whole of their income in different ways.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the income of both be supposed to be 2100<i>l.</i> sterling; and
let the branches of their expence be ranged under six different
heads. Let (A) be supposed to spend upon the first 100<i>l.</i> on the
second 200<i>l.</i> on the third 300<i>l.</i> on the fourth 400<i>l.</i> on the fifth
500<i>l.</i> on the sixth 600<i>l.</i> in all 2100<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>Let us suppose (A) to enjoy in every one an ample sufficiency.</p>

<p class='c001'>(B), on the other hand, spends upon his first article 1600<i>l.</i> and
upon each of the other five, no more than 100<i>l.</i> Here the first article
of (B’s) expence is sixteen times greater than any of the rest;
and by the supposition, 100<i>l.</i> is supposed to denote an ample sufficiency
upon each article.</p>

<p class='c001'>I come to (A), and I say to him, you disapprove of the <a id='corr524.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='extravavagance'>extravagance</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_524.24'><ins class='correction' title='extravavagance'>extravagance</ins></a></span>
of your neighbour (B) upon his first article of expence,
where he spends sixteen parts of his income, and where you spend
but one; and yet you must allow that upon every other article of
his expence, he is a better oeconomist than you. Would it not be
for your interest to bring the other articles of your expence down
to his standard, without increasing any thing upon your first article,
which is already within the compass of what may be called sufficient.</p>

<p class='c001'>To what purpose, says (A), would you advise me to so strict an
oeconomy? And what should I do with so great a saving on my
annual income? Be in no pain about that, I shall lay it out for you
in discharging your debts; in providing for your children, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>giving them a good education; in improving your estate; repairing
your house; making up your inclosures; all shall be usefully
spent; and out of 600<i>l.</i> a year, you shall have every thing necessary
for your family.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is the representation of a scheme between a good statesman,
and a people whose interest he consults.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the imposition of taxes, the individuals of a state, whose
income is already formed, begin to pay greatly more than they used
to do for every thing they consume. A great part of this additional
price goes to the public, and is thereby laid out for national purposes.
The whole of such expences are thrown into circulation, as
much as if the rich proprietors had laid it out upon articles entirely
adapted to their own taste.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not evident, that in this way of appropriating the income of
a country, it must produce a more extensive encouragement to industry
of all kinds, than if the proprietors only had spent it? They
never would have thought of becoming merchants, or of setting up
manufactures for the supply of foreign markets: their whole expence
would have been calculated to supply their own wants; and
it would have been indifferent to them whether these were supplied
by natives or by strangers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us apply this doctrine to common experience. Let us compare
the nature of circulation in a trading town, with that of a
country place, where many gentlemen of large fortunes reside.
How extensive the objects of the first! how contracted those of the
latter!</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us compare again the exigencies of government, with those
of a trading city, what a variety of <em>new</em> wants here occur to be supplied,
which the city never could have occasion for?</p>

<p class='c001'>I have shewn that the great amount of taxes is taken from the
income of those individuals whose fortune is already made, or
whose daily profits are considerable: I have suggested how circumscribed
the expence of this class must be, when considered with
respect to the employment it procures to the body of a people. Does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>not the experience of former ages show how apt private opulence
is to sink into treasures, when a taste for industry does not animate
the lower classes to create new objects of desire in the wealthy?
Wherein is a state benefited by the luxurious gratifications of the
rich, unless it be by the employment they procure for those who
provide the objects of luxury? Those very gratifications are, in one
sense, taxes upon the rich in favour of the industrious: they increase
expence, and throw money into circulation. In Spain and
Portugal, where industry is not introduced among the lower classes,
it is the strangers who in effect levy such taxes upon them. Were
the taxes they pay, properly applied to the encouragement of the
arts, instead of being appropriated to private purposes, and to enriching
private men, whose taste for expence is always circumscribed
to the objects of their own wants, how soon should we see
them vying with us in every market of Europe, and supplying
themselves as far as their country is calculated for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reciprocal wants of industrious nations, resemble the reciprocal
wants of tradesmen; all may be employed in supplying one
another, as well as themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the amount of taxes is properly laid out in premiums, for
the encouragement of the industrious, the prices of labour upon
articles of exportation, may be brought so low, that all nations
who do not follow the example, must languish and decay. Luxury
at home will then cease to hurt the trade of the nation. In her
treaties of commerce, she may throw open her ports to many articles
of foreign consumption, without running any risk by such
allowances; and on the other hand, she will reap the greatest advantages
from a reciprocal permission.</p>

<p class='c001'>The example I have given, by which I have illustrated the nature
of public contributions, must not be understood to tally with
respect to proportion. It would be both ridiculous and impossible
to reduce all the expences of rich men to the purely sufficient. All
I meant was, to shew how taxes, when properly applied, <em>may</em> be
considered as public oeconomy; and how the levying of them has
no direct tendency to hurt a nation in point of ease and prosperity.</p>

  <h3 id='ch5.8' class='c013'>CHAP. VIII. <br /> <i>Of the extent of Taxation.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>One good way to discover the nature of taxes, is, to examine
how far it may be possible to carry them. This is my intention
in this chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said that the object of taxes was income, and not stock. I
have shewn how those of the proportional kind affect the income of
stock already made, and persons who enjoy large profits upon their
daily industry. I have pointed out the impropriety of cumulative
taxes, when imposed upon such as draw nothing more from their
industry than an easy subsistence; and I have given a general preference
to those of the proportional kind; because they constantly
imply both alienation and consumption: alienation in those who
<em>advance</em> the taxes, <em>consumption</em> in those who pay them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could, therefore, taxes be levied upon every alienation, where
consumption is implied, and that in proportion to the whole superfluity
of those who are to consume, proportional taxes would be
carried to their utmost extent.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now analize this subject, in order to discover how far that
extent may reach; and by this inquiry, the principles of taxation
will be the better understood.</p>

<p class='c001'>The objects of alienation comprehend all that is in commerce
among men, moveable and immoveable.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is moveable is generally consumable, what is immoveable
is generally not so.</p>

<p class='c001'>As consumption is a requisite, together with alienation, in order
to form a proper basis for proportional taxes, we see how contrary
to principles it would be, to tax the alienation of lands, houses, &amp;c.
in the same proportion as consumable commodities. These are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span><em>funds</em>, not <em>income</em>; and the money with which they are purchased,
must be considered in the light of a fund, while it is in the hands
of the buyer. When once it comes into the hands of the seller of
the immoveable objects, it frequently, indeed, partakes of the
nature of income; that is to say, it is spent in the consumption
of fruits, and of the labour of man; and then it will be affected by
taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>This may suffice to recal to mind the principles we laid down in
the 26th chapter of the second book, concerning the effects of the
vibration of the balance of wealth between the members of a modern
state.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next thing we are to consider, is the state of circulation. As
to that, we have frequently observed, how it must be in proportion
to alienation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This proportion is not determined by the value, or denominations
of the money circulating; but by that value combined with the
frequency of transitions from hand to hand; as the force of a cannon
ball is estimated by the weight of the ball, and the swiftness
of the motion at the time it strikes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now lay aside the consideration of immoveable property;
and examine the nature of consumption, alienation, and sale, with
respect to other things.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consumption comprehends every thing produced by the earth,
or by man; alienation is confined to that part which is exchanged
between men; and sale to that part of alienation which is exchanged
for an equivalent in money.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever part is consumed without alienation, ought, I think, to
be out of the reach of proportional taxes, unless, by some circumstance
or other, it can be made to fall under the eye of the public,
in a manner <em>resembling</em> its coming to market. Thus a tax upon
malt is levied at the malt-house, as if it were sold to the maltster,
although it be made for the consumption of the grower of the
barley. In like manner, a tax upon corn for bread may be levied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>either at the mill where it is ground, or at the oven where it is
baked<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f45'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. Examples of these kinds of taxes were familiar in former times. Vassals were
obliged to grind in their Lord’s mill, bake in his oven, press their wine in the public
press of the territory, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was found very useful, in ages when alienation and sale were little known; but
now they are considered as oppressive, and so I think they are, when compared with
proportional taxes, which only take place upon the sale of the commodity: but still
they are far preferable to many taxes of the cumulative kind.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The worst kind of proportional taxes are those which are levied
upon <em>private</em> manufacturing, and upon unmanufactured consumption,
where no alienation takes place. An example of the first we
have in the excise upon malt, cyder, candles, &amp;c. made in private
houses for private use: the last is known in Holland, where a man
cannot kill his own pig, or his own calf, without paying a tax.
Were taxes of that nature extended to the making of bread, cooking
of victuals, &amp;c. I apprehend they would become of a nature more
burdensome than any hitherto invented, unless public cooks were
established, as public ovens are in many parts of France; in such
cases, taxes might be levied upon every part of consumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>Investigations of this nature are so disagreeable, that it is with
reluctance I mention them; but when, in fact, such taxes are
found established in different countries, it is highly proper, that the
nature of them should be inquired into.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes in Holland are so multiplied, as to descend to this category,
in many places, as we have seen by the example just given;
but even these, however oppressive they may appear to those who
are not accustomed to them, are still less so than many of the
cumulative kind we have mentioned, particularly the tax upon industry
and the capitation in France. They approach nearer to proportional
taxes, and derive every alleviation of their burden from
that circumstance. He who pays such taxes, sees that he can avoid
them, by retrenching his consumption; and when they fall upon
the necessaries of life, he may draw them back, providing he be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>industrious man, and that every one who enters into competition
with him for employment, be equally subjected to the same burden.
But they are more burdensome than those where sale takes
place; because when a poor man, who wishes to consume, wants
money, he considers himself in the same light as if the thing were
not to be sold; but when he has that which he has acquired by his
labour, and cannot consume it for want of money to pay for a permission,
as it were, he must either starve for hunger in the midst of
plenty, or be reduced, perhaps, to beggary, for having preserved his
life by defrauding the tax.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has been said, is, I think, sufficient to shew the varieties
which occur, when taxes are imposed upon bare consumption,
where no alienation takes place: they must, in every respect, be
ranged under those of the proportional kind, although some principal
requisites be wanting to engage any one to approve of their
institution.</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears still more difficult to establish a proportional tax upon
barter, or the exchange of commodities one for another, unless sale
be understood. This would be the case were a private person, not
subject to the excise upon malt made in his own house, to pay in
that commodity. He would not there escape the imputation of
fraud; and might, with propriety, be considered as a retailer. I do
not, however, doubt but examples of taxes upon barter might be
found; some even occur to myself; but they are almost too trifling
to mention<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c017'><sup>[46]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. Two gentlemen in France exchange casks of their wine, they are both obliged to
pay a tax upon removing the wine from their cellar. This duty is called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Remuage</i></span>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The last and principal requisite, to render proportional taxes easy
and light, is sale. There the burden must be proportional to the
buyers purse; and if it prevents the consumption of the thing taxed,
the defect will manifest itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of these taxes we may say, that they are in proportion to circulation;
and accordingly, we see how difficult it was to raise them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>so long as circulation remained confined to the small quantity of
coin in the country. As money increased, both by the increase
of trade and alienations, they became more productive; and were
the nature of them rightly understood, and were they properly imposed,
they would soon be more generally adopted.</p>

<p class='c001'>In treating of public credit, I have said that it is the duty of a
statesman to augment the quantity of money, in proportion as he
intends to multiply taxes on his people. I shall now, before I conclude
this chapter, explain the meaning of what was there thrown
out relatively to another subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>The money of a country, we have said, bears no determinate proportion
to circulation; it is the money circulating, multiplied by the
number of transitions from hand to hand. Again, we have said, that
the prices of all things are determined by demand and competition.
The meaning of this, as it concerns the present question, is, that
in proportion to the competition of those who appear with money,
in order to acquire what comes to market, a larger or a smaller sum
is brought into circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, according to the principles laid down in the first chapter,
we saw how the full value of the industrious seller’s expence and
profit were made up to him in the sale of his work; and if he even
advanced any tax upon any part of his work or consumption, that
it was refunded to him by the buyer, who, if he consumes in the
light of an idle man, pays for the whole.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farther, when a proportional tax is imposed, we said it was, in
a manner, as if the state interposed at the time of alienation, and
exacted of the purchaser a certain value in money, in proportion to
the commodity, as the price of the permission to acquire what his
own industry had not produced. From this I draw the following consequence,
that in proportion to the tax an additional sum of money is
drawn into circulation, which would otherwise have remained in
the pocket of the purchaser; consequently, on imposing proportional
taxes, they cannot, at first, exceed that proportion of money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>which is found in the pockets of the consumers, over and above
what they used to pay for what they consumed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The truth of this proposition is established upon many facts.
First, in countries where people keep their money locked up, proportional
taxes are very well paid. Hence the great amount of the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>alcavala</i></span> and <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>cientos</i></span> in Spain, which amount together to 14 <i>per cent.</i>
upon every consecutive alienation of the commodities, chiefly
indeed for the consumption of the rich.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, When excises were augmented in England, in the
reign of King William, Davenant tells us, that the price of the
goods excised fell.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, When a war has lasted any time in France, taxes cease
to be so productive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are not all these, and many other appearances, resolved upon the
same principle, viz. that taxes must come out of that money which
exceeds what was necessary for carrying on alienation before they
were imposed?</p>

<p class='c001'>In Spain they draw money from the chests of the hoarders, and
increase circulation for a while.</p>

<p class='c001'>In England, during King William’s wars, the quantity of money
being very small, and trade being very low, the tax upon malt
could come out of no other fund than the price usually given for
barley.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France, people are better acquainted with taxes, and the great
bulk of excises are administred by the farmers, who never lower
their price; so that the diminution of the mass of coin diminishes
consumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>But when methods can be fallen upon to increase money according
to the uses found for it, taxes will continue to produce, consumption
will not diminish, and circulation will keep pace with
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could we suppose, that before the imposition of taxes, every person
in a state had laid it down as a rule, to spend the whole of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>income, but none of his treasure, in the consumption of what is
brought to market, it is plain, that in a luxurious nation, taxes
might be carried so high as to draw the last farthing of the treasure
into circulation, even though it were supposed to exceed the value
which demand had fixed for all that was brought to market. But
without a luxurious turn this would not be the case. There are
countries abounding with coin, which it is impossible to come at by
proportional taxes. The reason is plain: the value which demand
fixes upon the total of the articles of consumption exposed to sale in
the country, bears but a trifling proportion to the coin which remains
locked up. This was the case in ancient Greece. In that case, proportional
taxes can never exhaust the treasure; because were they
to be made high upon articles of the first necessity, all the poor
would starve; if upon articles of superfluity, demand would stop.</p>

<p class='c001'>Proportional taxes, therefore, can only be raised in proportion to
the desire of spending money; and as this desire depends upon the
spirit of the people, so must the extent of taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me now trace a little the progress of money brought into circulation
by proportional taxes in a luxurious nation. I shall call
the value, fixed by demand, for all that comes to market (Y). The
sum levied in consequence of the alienation of it, or in other words,
the sum of the proportional taxes (X). And the whole money of
the country (Z). This premised, it will follow, from what has been
said, that so soon as all the money of the country is brought into
circulation, then (Z) will be exactly equal to the sum of (Y) and (X).</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next suppose the whole alienation to be made at once.
Will not (Z) then immediately appear divided into (Y) and (X)?
What then will become of those two sums which we suppose to
enter into circulation at the same time? I answer, that (Y) will go
entirely free to the industrious seller: that it is, or should be, nearly
equal to the former value of what came to market before taxes
were imposed: and that (X) is an additional sum drawn from the
idle consumers, who live upon an income already made. But suppose
(X) to be augmented, until it exceeds the quantity of money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>formerly superfluous for carrying on alienation: then I say, that
either taxes will become proportionally less productive, or consumers
must melt down the capital of their funds into paper money,
to the amount of the deficiency of (X); and this will supply
circulation with the additional sum required in consequence of the
imposition of taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, I think, it is a lucky circumstance, that the additional sum
of taxes should be paid by those very people who are the best able
to borrow it upon their funds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us proceed to examine the progress of (Y) and (X) as they
continue in circulation. (Y) is no sooner come into the hands of
the industrious seller, but he has occasion to go to market: that
moment I consider him as one of the rich; and the money which,
at the time he sold, had acquired the denomination of (Y), now resumes
that of (Z). When he comes to buy a commodity with what
was formerly his (Y), there is immediately a part of it converted into
a new (X), and the remainder keeps the denomination of (Y) in
the hands of him from whom he buys. By this progress it is plain,
that after a certain number of alienations, or transitions from hand
to hand, the whole quantity (Y) will be converted into (X).</p>

<p class='c001'>Experience shews this to be the fact; because the amount of
taxes, in a short time, far exceeds the value of all the money of a
country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next follow the progress of (X).</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the first alienation of any part of what comes to market for
the consumption of the proprietors of (Z), a proportional part of
(Z) is transformed into (X), and is carried into the public coffers.
Were it there to be locked up, and not thrown back into circulation,
it is plain, that in a short time the whole of (Z) would be converted
into (X), and would be shut up in the exchequer.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the amount of taxes, therefore, is sent out of the country
in time of war, must not this produce a similar effect? Has not the
exporting that amount the same effect with the locking it up, since
the one and the other equally take it out of circulation? Does it not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>then follow, that if more money be not obtained, either by borrowing
it back from strangers, or by melting down more solid property,
that selling must stop, and (Y) disappear as well as (X). The rich,
therefore, must give over buying, and the proprietors of all that
comes to market must deal by barter with one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>How naturally do all these consequences follow one upon the
other! and how exactly do they correspond to the principles which
run through that part of the last book where we treated of banks
and public credit!</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes are not raised, at this time, to remain in treasures, but to
answer the exigencies of the state. The moment, therefore, that
the money arising from them comes out of the public coffers, it loses
the character of (X) and resumes that of (Z), in the same manner
that (Y) was transformed into (Z), by being brought to market to
buy a commodity. This new (Z), as we may call it, no sooner
returns into circulation, than it becomes again converted into (Y)
and (X), with this difference, however, that what came from the
exchequer, so far as it is converted into (X), returns directly into it
again.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence it follows, that states commonly pay their servants the
full of their salaries, and make them refund a part in consequence
of cumulative taxes, instead of proportionally diminishing what is
due to them. And when the salaries themselves are intended to be
laid under poundage, which in fact is an actual diminution of them,
they choose that the tax should appear to be a deduction out of
what is supposed due; because it seems less arbitrary to impose a
tax, than to diminish a salary, without assigning any reason for it;
but indeed, besides this reason, it commonly happens, that the particular
appropriations and administration of the revenue render that
method easier.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to proportional taxes they affect the expences of the
state in the same manner as those of individuals; with this difference,
as we have said, that the part (X) returns into the exchequer;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>but the part (Y) is fairly spent by the state, as by the idle
consumer.</p>

<p class='c001'>From what has been said, we may gather the principles which
lead to the most extensive establishment of proportional taxes, viz.
either to draw by particular regulations, the whole real and gross
produce of land and work to market; or at least to bring it under
the eye of the state, in consequence of some modification or manufacture
performed upon it, as was observed with respect to malt-houses,
mills, and public ovens. When, by such contrivances,
the whole gross produce falls under taxation, the proportional
taxes must be gently laid on, and gradually raised until they begin
to interrupt consumption; then they must be diminished for a
while, until dissipation increases; a case which will probably happen,
as it commonly keeps pace with industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we suppose the rich to set out on a plan of living upon
their capitals, instead of living upon their incomes, as we have
hitherto supposed, then indeed taxes may augment to a degree not
to be estimated. This combination has already found a place in
the 26th chapter of the second book, where we examined it with
regard to the progress of industry. In that place it was said, that
in proportion to credit and industry, it might be possible in the
compass of a year, to produce commodities to the value of the
whole property of the most extended kingdom. Were that the
case, to what a height might not taxes be carried?</p>

<p class='c001'>(Y) then would represent the whole value of the country, and
consequently, (X) would swell in proportion, according to the
competition among the inhabitants, to purchase every particular
article. Subsistence and necessaries might be taxed low in proportion
to the abilities of those of the lower classes; articles of luxury
might be taxed in a higher proportion, in order to draw the more
into the exchequer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were taxes thus carried to their utmost extent, still every person
in the state must be left at liberty to save, or to spend the whole,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>or any part of his stock, or income; which is not the case when
cumulative taxes are imposed. Proportional taxes, tho’ carried to
their utmost extent, will not deprive an industrious man of his
physical-necessary, nor of the reward of his ingenuity, nor of
that rank in wealth, to which his birth or expence entitles him<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c017'><sup>[47]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r47'>47</a>. A man’s rank, in a modern society, seems to be determined more according to
his birth, or to his expence, than according to his stock, or income.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When taxes have the effect of interrupting this harmony of expence,
of restraining the liberty of squandering, or of saving, or
of oppressing one set of men more than another, in all such cases,
they are improperly imposed; and instead of being too high, as it
is commonly supposed, I think it is a demonstration that they are
really lower than they need to be. The classes of men in a modern
state, resemble the horses in a team. When every horse draws
fairly and equally, the whole force is exerted; but if any one happens
to be strained by an overcharge thrown upon him, the force
of the team is greatly diminished.</p>

<p class='c001'>When proportional taxes are carried to their full extent, I then
presume every one will be obliged to pay as much as possible; I
do not mean that every one will be forced to pay to the extent of
his abilities, but I say, that the generality will; and therefore,
were cumulative, or personal taxes, to be superadded on those who
already pay all they can, they would, by affecting them unequally,
deprive many of their physical-necessary, or small profits; and
consequently destroy the proper balance of their competition.
The setting the lower classes free from cumulative taxes, will
only have the effect of putting the growing wealth of the penurious
and saving part of the industrious inhabitants out of the
reach of taxation. This ought in good policy to be done, as has
been shewn in another place. But, farther, we have observed,
that taxes can only be increased in proportion to the spirit of dissipation
in the people. To force money, therefore, out of the hands
of those who do not incline to spend it, is forcing the spirit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>the people; and if not tyranny, is at least great severity. Besides,
we shall presently shew, how these savings cannot escape being
taxed, whenever they begin to produce an income; and allowing
that they may be greatly accumulated, and thrown into
trade, yet still they must in one way or other appear in alienation,
and become subject to the proportional taxes. The only part,
therefore, of the savings not affected by taxes, will be confined to
that which is locked up. This in a prodigal nation should never
be touched. The inconveniencies resulting to the state from so
small an inequality of taxation, is too trifling to be attended to,
and too difficult to be prevented.</p>

<p class='c001'>I come next to examine the extent of cumulative taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we suppose the proportional taxes to be carried to their full
extent, there will be little place found for the cumulative, as has
been said. The only objects left for them are the savings locked
up, and the pure profits upon trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>But let us suppose proportional taxes out of the question, as they
must be when contrary to the spirit of a particular nation; and
then inquire into the principles which regulate the imposition of
cumulative taxes, in order to discover to what extent they may be
carried, and what consequences may follow when they are brought
to a height.</p>

<p class='c001'>This branch has two objects; first, income, which is determinate;
secondly, profits from industry, which are and must be
very uncertain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Income, I divide into two sorts; that which proceeds from every
branch of solid property, capable of producing it: Land, houses,
even cattle, furniture, &amp;c. all may, in some respects, produce an
income, more or less permanent according to circumstances. This
sort of income is established by lease. The second sort is the interest
of money, constituted by the contract of loan.</p>

<p class='c001'>In imposing cumulative taxes upon income, it is very proper to
consider the nature of every species of it, with respect to stability.
Landed property is fixed, and can not escape taxation, were the tax
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>to be carried to the extent of the full income, as has been observed.
Were the same proportion to be laid on houses, they would soon
fall to ruin, because the annual proprietor would not keep them
up. Like circumstances must be attended to, in taxing every other
article of revenue.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method of ascertaining the value of this kind of property,
is to oblige all leases to be recorded, under a sufficient penalty.
This is the method in France, for the sake of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>controle</i></span>, which is
exacted upon recording them; and this, no doubt, facilitates the
raising of the twentieth penny, which operates upon all such
incomes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The value once ascertained, the whole income is at the mercy of
the state, in proportion to the impossibility of avoiding it, by any
change on the nature of the fund. It is from this circumstance
that I call all such taxes arbitrary impositions. And I call them
also cumulative; because the reason given by the statesman for imposing
them, is, that it is just every one should pay a general tax,
for the support of the state, in proportion to his abilities.</p>

<p class='c001'>As these taxes cannot be carried beyond the value of the income
which the proprietor cannot withdraw from under the burden, we
see the impossibility of establishing them upon that income which
proceeds from money. If a tax of so much <i>per cent.</i> be imposed
upon money lent at interest; the lender may immediately call in his
capital from his debtor, and send it away beyond the reach of the
tax. If the calling it in be prohibited, then all credit is destroyed
for the future, and no more money will be lent. If the statesman
should incline to profit of the advantage found in securing
money upon land-property; and if, trusting to the desire monied-people
have of settling their capitals in that way, he should take one
or more per cent. upon capitals so secured; it will still have the
effect of hurting the credit of landed men, who have frequently
no good security but their land to give.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>It was formerly the practice to allow the landlords to retain a
part of the interest, in consideration of the tax they paid upon that
part of their land, which was pledged for the security of the money
borrowed; but when credit is once established, that regulation has
no other effect, than to oblige them to borrow so much dearer
than other people, who have no retention to claim. Where indeed
credit is precarious, such a regulation would be a premium for good
security.</p>

<p class='c001'>In general, I believe, we may safely determine, that all attempts
to lay a tax upon the income of so fluctuating a property as money,
where the capital is demandable, will prove unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c001'>The case is different, when the capital is not demandable, as has
been observed in the end of the 8th chapter upon public credit;
where we were suggesting a reason for taxing the interest of national
debts, when grown up to the full amount of all the income
of a country. But a material distinction was there made, between
those debts which were supposed to be consolidated into a permanent
property, and new contracts which were to be considered as
debts upon that property.</p>

<p class='c001'>We see, therefore, the extent of cumulative taxes upon possessions
which produce an income. Let us next examine how they
may be made to affect other articles.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have observed how improper, and how contrary to principles
it is, to impose proportional taxes upon those branches of sale,
which do not change the balance of wealth between the contracting
parties. Yet cumulative taxes may then take place;
because there is no reason to make them general, or proportional.</p>

<p class='c001'>When lands, for example, carry titles along with them, as is
the case in many countries; and when, as with us in Scotland
they carry a right to vote for a member of parliament, a very
heavy tax might be imposed upon the alienation of them. The same
may be said of every other estate which requires a feudal investiture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>to compleat the right. Thus the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Lods et vente</i></span> in France, which
is a portion of the price of such lands due to the superior or lord-paramount
of the fee, amounting in many cases to the sixth part
of the price, is a hint for a cumulative tax to be raised upon the
alienation of this kind of property.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were cumulative taxes properly laid upon personal service, a regularity
in levying them at short intervals, and according to some
determinate proportion, would do a great deal towards communicating
to them all the advantages of those of the proportional kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus a tax laid upon those who work by the day, may be levied
in such a manner as to be tolerably easy. A penny a day (or more
if necessary) paid by every industrious man, regularly, once a week,
would soon enable him to raise his price in that proportion. But
then deductions must be allowed for all accidental impediments;
and were a plan to be concerted, many other considerations would
enter into it, which it would be superfluous here to mention, and
which, perhaps, may occur in another place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The two articles which, in analizing the extent of proportional
taxes, we observed had escaped that imposition, to wit, money
locked up, and the pure profits on trade constantly accumulated
into the stock, are equally ill adapted to bear a cumulative tax. I
can see no way of taxing money locked up, any more than money
lent, without opening a door to the greatest oppression. And as to
the pure profits on trade, although they appear to be income, I
rather consider them as stock, which, according to principles, ought
not to be taxed. My reason for not considering them as income, is
because we have supposed them to be accumulated by the merchant
into his trading stock. They resemble the annual shoots of a tree,
which augment the mass of it, but are very different from the seed
or fruit which is annually produced, and is annually separated
from it. If they are spent by the merchants, then they are undoubtedly
income, and will be affected by proportional taxes; but
as they may also not be spent, and become stock, the cumulative
tax will affect them in both cases.</p>

  <h3 id='ch5.9' class='c013'>CHAP. IX. <br /> <i>The consequences of an Abolition of Taxes.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Having endeavoured to deduce the principles of taxation, by
examining the combinations which occur when we suppose
it augmented to the highest degree, I must now look for new
combinations, which will suggest themselves upon examining the
consequences of a total, or a partial abolition of taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as taxes are absolutely necessary for the support of government,
no body, I suppose, can wish to see them abolished. The
object, therefore, of a statesman’s attention in levying taxes for indispensable
national purposes, should turn upon the principles we
have been examining. What now follows relates to the consequences
of abolishing taxes once established, so far as it proves a
revolution in the oeconomy of a state. This will lead us to examine
the consequences of taxes, considered as voluntary public contributions,
independently of the absolute necessity of raising them to
supply the exigencies of the state. We are therefore to examine the
consequences of so great a change to the whole body of the society,
considered as a nation, which requires a public stock, to which it
may have recourse upon every extraordinary occasion.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the interest of a whole people is examined with respect to
taxes, they may very properly be divided into the following classes.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Those who receive the amount of taxes, viz. the creditors
and servants of the state, and those to whom they give employment.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, Those who advance the taxes, viz. all the different classes of
the industrious.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, Those who pay the taxes, viz. all the rich and idle; or, in
other words, all those who cannot draw back what they have paid.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>In these classes are comprehended those who pay the taxes, and
those who receive the amount of them; consequently, in whatever
concerns taxes, the common interest of the whole taken together is
what must regulate the conduct of the statesman.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to determine this first and general question, viz. the consequence
of abolishing taxes relatively to the cumulative interest of
a whole state, it is proper to inquire,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, What will be the consequence of abolishing taxes, relatively
to those who now receive the amount of them, viz. the creditors and
servants of the public, and those to whom they give employment.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, What will be the consequences of abolishing taxes relatively
to trade, industry, and manufactures: that is, whether these great
objects are carried on to most advantage, when every individual
contributes largely in providing a fund to be administred by a statesman;
or when no body contributes any thing, but when every one
retains the whole of his income, and the profits of his industry,
and disposes of them as he thinks proper.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, What will be the consequence of abolishing taxes, relatively
to that part of the people who now complain that they are forced to
contribute to every tax, although by their exclusion from the emoluments
of lucrative employments, they bear a greater burden than
others not better entitled to exemption, who thereby profit at their
expence?</p>

<p class='c001'>To determine so intricate a question, several combinations of
circumstances must here be examined, and from the particulars
resulting in every case, we shall, towards the end of this chapter,
endeavour to point out the general conclusion. I begin by examining
the consequences arising to the creditors, and to those who
serve the state, from the cessation of those expences which flow
from the produce of taxes, either in paying the interest of debts, or
in defraying the whole <em>actual</em> expence of government.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the creditors, this question has been already discussed. We
have seen that the withholding the interest due to them would have
the consequence of bringing on such a convulsion in the state, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>breach of faith, and ruin of public credit, as would throw every
thing into confusion. But with respect to the servants of the state,
we must inquire, whether the raising taxes for defraying this
article of expence be more hurtful to the people in general, than
the consequences of such a revolution in circulation and employment,
which would follow, if the taxes were to be suppressed, and
the servants employed by the state dismissed.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the necessity of raising taxes is out of the question, the hurt
they do in general to a country is when, by the imposition, the
money is taken out of those hands who would have employed it
for the advancement of the prosperity of the state, in order to throw
it into those who will employ it otherwise. From this let us now
draw some conclusions.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, That if money be taken from those who would have employed
it in feeding themselves, and in continuing their industry,
the cessation of such a tax is in a manner giving bread to those who
are starving.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, If money were to be taken from those who, having more
than bare necessaries, would, by its use, increase the demand for
domestic industry, and were that money bestowed on a set of men
who would employ it in the purchase of foreign commodities; the
cessation of taxes, in such a case, would, so far, take the bread
out of the mouths of foreigners, and give it to our own countrymen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The abolition of the first species of taxes is advantageous to a state
in every combination, let the money arising from it be ever so well
employed. As to the second species, the abolition is not necessary;
because the vice lies only in the misapplication of the amount.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us then suppose taxes to become unnecessary, and all
those of the hurtful kind, depriving the industrious of bread, and
enriching foreigners at the expence of citizens, to be taken off.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose that after all, there should still remain more taxes than
are sufficient for supplying all the necessary charges of government,
when administred with prudence and with oeconomy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>that this surplus is bestowed in gratifying individuals, beyond the
value of all the services they do the state: I ask whether this superfluous
expence is immediately to be cut off, and taxes diminished
in proportion; or whether it would not be more proper to let the
taxes subsist, and to think of a better method of applying the amount
of them?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that according to the state of the question, the body of
the people, who are all made to contribute towards the enriching of a
few of their number, may justly complain of the inequality of their
condition, and have a title to demand an abolition of their taxes,
unless it can evidently be made appear, that by granting their
request, there would follow a prejudice to the state, which would
affect their own interests as individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'>To discover how far this may be the case, let us form as many
combinations as we can, relative to the effects of diminishing taxes,
and candidly examine the most natural consequences of every one.
If we find that the mass of a people gain, in general, more than
they lose by paying taxes imposed with moderation and propriety,
and still more if it appears that their ease and prosperity depend
upon the levying and expending of such taxes; I think we may conclude,
that all diminutions of them which hurt the interest of the
greater body, are in general hurtful to the society.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me first suppose a general reform of all unnecessary expence
to take place at once, and a proportional abolition of taxes to go
hand in hand with it. Would not all those who at present subsist
by the superfluous expences of government, be reduced to misery?
Would not all those who supply unnecessary wants, equal to the
whole amount of the taxes suppressed, be forced to be idle in proportion?
The millions who contribute in paying those sums would
be differently affected. Those who pay out of a fixed and certain
income, would feel an immediate benefit from it; those who contribute
by proportional taxes would also be gainers, providing they
be of the idle class; but all the industrious would lose in proportion,
if the prices of subsistence should not fall with the diminution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>of their taxes. All the manufacturers of exciseable goods,
who had been used to <em>advance the taxes</em>, as we have observed, would
gain considerably. For the diminution of the taxes would be total
as to them, though not to their customers; because traders would
never want pretences for keeping up the price of their commodities
beyond the proportion of what it ought to be, when duties are
taken off.</p>

<p class='c001'>I decide with the greater certainty as to this particular, from the
analogy it bears to the consequence of changing the denominations
of the coins in France, which long experience shews never to have
the immediate effect of regulating prices proportionally.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as we are here considering the consequences of a sudden abolition
of taxes, let us, for a moment, consider, with an eye of humanity,
the scenes which would unavoidably open to our view,
both in the formerly opulent habitations of those who were wont
to wallow in public money, and in the comfortable dwellings of
many others of every denomination, who, either as the reward of
merit, or as the recompence of painful industry, had supplied the
wants of useless armies, navies, arsenals, dock-yards, &amp;c. formerly
paid out of taxes, now abolished, and who thereby had subsisted
and brought up their families.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are not all these children of the state? Have they not had fathers
and mothers who have been greatly relieved by procuring such
outlets for them? Have they not children who are educated and
brought up with the amount of their salaries, and profits of their
service? Have they not had people of every class of industry, who
have gained their bread by providing for their wants, while they
were supplying those of the state, now become superfluous? In one
word, does not the money they receive, circulate and return to the
grand river, as I may call it, in the same manner as that of other
members of the state?</p>

<p class='c001'>For these reasons, I say, that taxes once properly imposed, and
brought to circulate through a certain channel for a long time, cannot,
<em>suddenly</em>, be suppressed, without occasioning far greater misery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>and distress than can arise from them, when levied with any
degree of intelligence. This is nowise peculiar to the suppression
of taxes; it is equally the same, in every sudden revolution of
property. When the Templers were universally rooted out of
Christendom, who doubts of the afflictions, misery, and distress,
which followed to every class of inhabitants employed by them,
in every kingdom in Europe? Could so large a consumption as
that of so great an order cease at once, without drawing along
with it numberless inconveniences? Did not the reformation itself,
otherwise so great a blessing, starve a multitude of poor who were
fed by the monastries? Did not the secularization of so many ecclesiastical
benefices do great prejudice to many families, by blotting
out an infinity of ways of procuring an easy livelihood for their
children? Let those who do not feel the truth of what I here advance,
examine the state of the protestant nobility in Germany,
where you find the same hardships still subsisting, though in a
degree much inferior to what it must have been at the time of this
sudden revolution, which took bread from thousands of the younger
sons of noble families.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such revolutions have happened; such inconveniences have been
felt: but they were not the deliberate act of any particular statesman.
They were the effect of those convulsions which the human
passions occasion. No body can justly impute them as necessary consequences
of a reformation in religion. But let any statesman now,
from a cool reflection upon the unnecessary load of employments
in church, state, army, navy, finances, and law, and from a principle
of distributive justice, abolish <em>at once</em> all that is superfluous,
and the taxes, at the same time, out of which the emoluments arise,
he will very soon set before the eyes of his people, such a scene of
compassion, as will quickly blot out the remembrance of the favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>We should not then find some individuals reduced to want, but
numerous families; not a parcel of beggars starved, but industrious
manufacturers; not a set of ecclesiastics, who from their state of celibacy
and retreat, appeared already, in a manner, separated from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>the commonwealth, but a multitude of people connected by marriage,
by society, and by all the tender bonds which unite mankind.
Such a scene, I say, would not fail to excite compassion
in the heart of those very men in whose favour the desolation was
to be brought on; and the statesman would thereby lose the whole
merit of his ill judged zeal for distributive justice, and be considered
in the most unfavourable light that passion or prejudice could
suggest.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a digression introduced with no intention to favour a misapplication
of public money, but to point out how far a reformation
in this particular is a delicate operation.</p>

<p class='c001'>A good physician never attacks a disease by violent remedies, when
mild ones, with time, may be made to produce the same effect.
Nothing can resemble an ingrained disease in a human body, more
than an ingrained vicious habit in a state. The spirit of a nation is
influenced, as has been said, by the administration of its government.
So large a sum of misapplied money creates a political disease,
which must be purged away by degrees; and new doors must
be opened to receive those whose former method of subsistence is
thereby intended to be cut off.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me next examine the consequence of a gradual and insensible
reduction of taxes, relatively to trade, industry, and manufactures.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be both tedious and superfluous to trace the steps by
which such an operation ought to be conducted. Let me suppose it
compleat; but let it not be so very gradual as to blot out all remembrance
of the age of taxes, and of their effects.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have sufficiently analized the whole progress of circulation;
we have shewn how it must constantly be in proportion to alienation,
and how, when deficient, industry suffers a check. Even
when peace is restored after an expensive war, we have shewn how
circulation diminishes, from the abatement of public expences, how
money stagnates, and how it is consolidated upon property of a more
permanent nature.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>Let us now apply these principles to the question before us. Let
taxes be abolished ever so gradually, the circulation of the exchequer
must cease in proportion; consequently, the whole alienation,
and the whole industry which is the object of that alienation, must
cease also. The money issued from thence at present, continues its
progress from hand to hand, and all is found necessary for circulation,
in this age of taxation, as we have called it. What a deal
of industry is implied in the circulation of a sum equal to all the
taxes! Let those who choose to calculate, state the following proportion,
because I will not here interrupt my subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the whole money of the country is to all the alienations performed
by it, so is the sum of taxes to that part of alienation which
will fall with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a gradual diminution of taxes must have the effect of extinguishing
so much industry, it will have the effect of starving the
industrious who lived by it. But before they starve, the price of
work must fall below the price of the narrowest subsistence: because
the never failing foreign demand for subsistence, will keep it above
the rate of their slender abilities, as long as any trade remains.</p>

<p class='c001'>To imagine a foreign outlet for cheap manufactures, while the
subsistence of workmen is at par with other nations, is against
all principles; as it is against experience, to see a country without
revenue, and without taxes, carrying on with success the operations
of industry and foreign trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>Compare, therefore, the situation of such manufacturers with
those in the age of taxes. Compare those who would augment a
supply far beyond all the demand for it, with those who are paying
large taxes, and as regularly drawing them back, either upon the
sale of their work, or in consequence of wages which enable them
to be idle two or three days in a week.</p>

<p class='c001'>In such a situation, how ardently would the former wish to see
the idle consumers furnishing again a copious supply of money to
government, for removing such inconveniences. They would then
quickly perceive that they had not been of that class which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>felt the load of taxes; they would recal to mind the joyful hours
they had spent in public houses; the fortunes which every industrious
man might hope to accumulate, while every branch of
industry was kept alive, by the means of a copious circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, therefore, the industrious classes of a people cannot be benefited
by an abolition of taxes; let us next inquire, to whom the
advantage would accrue.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been said, that the idle consumers pay all taxes of the proportional
kind; the proprietors of lands, houses, &amp;c. bear every
where a very large share of taxes both proportional and cumulative.
This class of men, therefore, are those who bid the fairest to reap
a benefit from an abolition of them. But the proprietors of lands
are by no means included in the class of idle consumers, in every
respect; altho’ they may be considered in that light, with respect
to such taxes upon their consumption as they do not draw back
from their direct industry, in producing some manufacture which
they may sell again, with a profit proportional to the tax they paid.
They are masters of a property, which, in a country of industry,
is daily augmenting in its value. Their fortunes, often swell
faster than those of any one class of the industrious; but they augment
by annual income; the fortunes of all the rest, increase by
the capital. Every penny raised in a landlord’s rent, is equivalent
to half a crown gained by a merchant.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be true that taxes, rightly imposed, do no prejudice to any
of the manufacturing, or any-wise industrious classes of a people;
and if it be true, that an abolition of those taxes, by contracting
circulation, would discourage industry; then we may determine
that the landlords would lose much more in finding the improvement
of their lands interrupted, than all they can gain by adding
their taxes to their present fortunes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Combinations of this sort are so involved, that I cannot pretend
to unfold them step by step, as might be done in cases of a more
simple nature. The conclusions therefore drawn from researches of
this kind, do not command that assent, which we find in a manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>extorted from us upon other occasions. In this chapter, I have
not undertaken to demonstrate that the judicious imposition of
taxes is advantageous to a country in every respect. My view is to
point out the advantages they actually have. The common opinion
is that they are hurtful. Our feelings, however, have raised doubts
with many great men concerning the truth of that proposition.
If my investigations, however imperfect, and however liable to
objections, should facilitate to others the clearing up a point, which
is beyond the reach of my capacity to extricate, this consideration
will be a sufficient encouragement for me to proceed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me, therefore, lay aside the thoughts of analizing the effects of
taxes, with such accuracy as to form a demonstration of their being
more beneficial than hurtful to an industrious nation, and that the
throwing them back into circulation does more good, than the
raising them does harm. But let me shew, in general, that the
interest of landed men, who, I think have, beyond all doubt, been
proved to be those who, in the first place, pay a considerable part
of proportional taxes, does by no means require an abolition of
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proprietors of lands, whom we have hitherto considered
as being of the class of the idle consumers, advance their rents by
the great demand produced for subsistence, in consequence of industry.
This, if it does not raise the price of subsistence, keeps
it, at least, at an equal standard; and that standard must bear a
proportion to what it is worth in other nations, as long as trade
subsists. But let trade decay, let domestic industry fail, it will not
be the foreign price which will then support the rate of our
markets. What a multitude of circumstances contribute to the
exportation of our superfluity! I can send from Charing-cross, any
parcel whatever, to the distance of fifty miles, cheaper than from
my own country habitation, where I can have a man, with a cart,
for two shillings a day. From Charing-cross, I can send, at an
hour’s warning, many thousand tuns weight: here I could not do
the same in many weeks. Near London, an extended common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>may be inclosed and improved in a season: here, the improvement
of a small field is the business of a man’s life. Let me even consider
how matters are changed within these fifty years. Undertakings
which now are executed with little difficulty, were
then absolutely impracticable. An army was necessary thirty years
ago to make a road of a hundred miles, and the inhabitants were
astonished at the execution of it<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f48'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r48'>48</a>. Wade’s road through the highlands of Scotland.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Were it necessary, at this time, to do as much every year, if money
be but provided, hands will not be wanting, either to conduct
or execute the plan.</p>

<p class='c001'>The number of people, <em>well employed</em>, makes the prosperity of a
state; and the profits of the opulent classes, by the augmentation
of industry, more than compensates all the burden of their taxes.
They grow in relative wealth; and the acquisitions they make, are
commonly exempted from the cumulative taxes raised upon their
possessions. In proportion to their industry in improving their
lands, their fortunes augment. The present system of taxes does
not interrupt their operations. Were any great change in that particular
to take place, which might sink the market prices of subsistence,
even allowing that it would prove an advantage to foreign
trade, they, I am sure, would be the first who would feel the inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be wondered, why I have not suggested, as a consequence
of taxes, the increase upon the price of the earth’s productions,
which is a direct indemnification to all the landed interest, more
than equivalent to the taxes they pay. But taxes upon land, do
not augment the price of grain, as they raise the price of exciseable
goods. The reason is plain. The tax upon land affects only
the proprietor’s share of the produce of his lands: were he to attempt
to raise the price of his grain, in proportion to the tax he
pays, his farmer, who pays no land-tax for his portion, would
undersell him in the market. A tax never can raise a price, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>when it is laid on so universally, as to make it impossible for any
person to avoid it, who sells in competition with another who pays
the duty. It is from this principle that smuggling often ruins fair
traders: the smuggled goods are sold cheaper than those which pay
duty, and the fair trader is thereby forced to sell below what he can
afford.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, I believe that when this question is thoroughly
understood, it will be found, that taxes affect prices far less than
any one could imagine; except in the case of excises, rightly imposed,
and levied without fraud. There indeed they have their
effect; but in every other mode of imposing them, I am apt to
believe that they do not produce the consequences commonly
ascribed to them. I have already suggested the reason in a former
chapter upon this subject; where the influences of competition in
the markets where commodities are sold, has been proved to work
more irresistible effects in regulating the price of work in general,
than any thing that taxes, not immediately imposed upon the very
article of consumption, can produce. But if in spite of all that has
been said, it should be urged that the prices of labour and manufactures
rise in proportion to taxes, I answer, that the difficulties resulting
upon this hypothesis, would be many more than could be objected
to the other theory. Could, for example, any man assign a
reason why a pound of the best snuff in England should be sold
dearer than in France, where it pays a duty of above two shillings
sterling; why many articles of manufacture can be afforded
cheaper in England, than in Scotland, where taxes are certainly
lower, and although a day-labourer in the first be paid a shilling,
and in the last little more than eight pence; why subsistence should
be absolutely dearer in Scotland than in England, taken upon an
average; why universal experience should prove, that when the
price of subsistence is raised by scarcity, work instead of rising, is
constantly lower than at other times?</p>

<p class='c001'>From all these appearances, added to the arguments I have
used to prove that taxes are not prejudicial to industry, I conclude,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>that the theory I have attempted to give is just in the main;
and that when taxes are judiciously imposed, and actually levied
without oppression, they enrich a nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, By putting into the hands of a good statesman, the means
of removing every abuse; of rendering the state respected by its
enemies; of supporting every class of industrious inhabitants,
when their particular branch falls under distress; of providing an
outlet for many young people, who in time become ornaments to
their country, and instruments of her defence; of supporting
foreign trade by bounties on exportation; of encouraging the improvement
of lands, the establishment of colonies, the extension of
fisheries, and every other scheme for augmenting the production
of subsistence and manufactures.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, That the multiplication of taxes, exclusive of the encouragements
just mentioned, which are bestowed gratuitously on
trade and manufactures, do, of themselves, and independently of
the proper application of their amount, augment, demonstratively,
the mass of circulation, alienation and industry; and in this
respect may be considered as a voluntary contribution, in the first
place at least, from the rich who pay them, to the industrious who
directly draw them back.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, As to that part of the people, who pay their taxes without
sharing the advantages of those who serve the state in lucrative
employments, I say the industrious part of them pay nothing; and
the demand for what they produce, is greatly increased by the expence
of those very men who are the objects of their envy: and
farther, that if an alteration were to be made on the revenue, by
any abolition of taxes, those who imagine themselves hurt at
present, might find, by sad experience, a much greater, and much
more real hurt, from what would disturb the harmony of the present
system.</p>

<p class='c001'>To conclude, we have a tolerable notion of the state of industry
in former times, when taxes were little known: we may see the
progress it is making in countries where, at present, impositions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>are comparatively lower than elsewhere; and we may compare
the state of those countries with our own, as to ease and happiness.
From such inquiries, nothing, I apprehend, can be concluded in
favour of the progress of industry, from an abolition of taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>That such an abolition may produce some good effect, as yet unknown,
I shall not pretend to deny: we have not lived long enough
to see any experiment of this kind put in practice.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the exposition I have given of this matter, there arises a
great difficulty to be solved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes are paid, no doubt, and no body according to this theory
seems to pay them. The industrious draw them back; the proprietors
of land and solid property are said to be indemnified;
prices, it would appear, are not to fall by a diminution of taxes,
in favour even of the most idle consumer; they are not made to
rise in consequence of an augmentation on them: Whence then do
taxes proceed? From what fund do they arise? What interest do
they affect? I can solve all these difficulties, by an answer to another
question. From whence arises the value of a small parcel of
flax, when wrought into fine lace? It arises from the price paid for
time well employed; which produces nothing when spent in idleness.
This is the fund out of which the greatest part of taxes is
paid; it is a fund created by the industrious Britons, which I hope
will increase for many centuries, tho’ taxes should increase in proportion.
It is worth more than ten times all the taxes which could
be raised, and all the landed property without it. Let that time
be spent in idleness, and the whole produce of this island would not
supply the expences of government for a month.</p>

  <h3 id='ch5.10' class='c013'>CHAP. X. <br /> <i>Are taxes a spur to industry, as some pretend?</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is not easy to find out, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>, how taxes should prove a spur
to industry. What makes several people adopt this opinion is
their feelings, in consequence of many circumstances arising from
experience, rather than what reason, or the nature of the thing has
pointed out. But as nothing can be produced without an adequate
and natural cause, it is proper to examine this political problem, by
an application of the principles we have laid down in the former
chapters. If these be just, we shall discover by them, how it happens
that in countries where taxes are high, where living is dear,
and where every circumstance seems to render the means of subsistence
difficult to obtain, people live in the greatest plenty, are best
and most easily subsisted, and that industry there makes the greatest
progress.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the solution of this question, let us call to mind the principles
which influence the multiplication of mankind, and the increase
of labour and industry, laid down in the first book. We there explained
how the wants of mankind promote their multiplication.</p>

<p class='c001'>Money, the instrument of alienation, was represented as the
primum mobile in this operation; a desire in the rich of acquiring
every thing with money, that is <em>demand</em>, was shewn to be
the spur to industry in the poor. It was said, that if riches did
not inspire a taste for luxury, that is for the consumption of the
labour of man, these riches would not circulate; and that they
would then be adored rather as a god, than made subservient to
the uses of men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Connect herewith that the imposition of taxes is a method of
bringing money into circulation; that those of the proportional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>kind have the effect of drawing from the rich, an additional price
upon every thing they buy, which goes for the use of the state,
and which otherwise would not have entered into circulation at
that time.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these principles, I conclude, that taxes promote industry;
not in consequence of their being raised upon individuals, but in
consequence of their being expended by the state; that is, by increasing
demand and circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the principles above laid down, I cannot discover the
shadow of a reason, to conclude that the taking arbitrarily away
from some individuals, a part of their gains by cumulative taxes,
or proportionally from others, by augmenting the price of what
they buy and consume, must in any respect imply an incitement
in the consumers to demand more; and without this it never can
excite the industrious to augment the supply.</p>

<p class='c001'>I readily allow that every one who has been obliged to pay a
tax, may have a desire to indemnify himself of the expence he
has been put to, by augmenting his industry; but if on the other
hand, taxes have put every one to a considerable additional expence,
in proportion to his estate, it would be absurd to allege
this diminution of his fortune, as the cause of a desire to augment
his consumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>Examine on the other hand, the use made by the state of the
money raised, and you will easily perceive the justness, I think,
of the above mentioned principles. This money belongs to the
public, and is administred by private people. Public expence is
defrayed with a full hand; they who bestow the money, bestow it
for the public, not for themselves; and they who work for the
public, find, or ought to find, the greatest encouragement to be
diligent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every application of public money implies a want in the state;
and every want supplied, implies an encouragement given to industry.
In proportion, therefore, as taxes draw money into circulation,
which otherwise would not have entered into it at that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>time, they encourage industry; not by taking the money from individuals,
but by throwing it into the hands of the state, which
spends it; and which thereby throws it directly into the hands of
the industrious, or of the luxurious who employ them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is no objection to this representation of the matter, that the
persons from whom the money is taken, would have spent it as
well as the state. The answer is, that it might be so, or not:
whereas when the state gets it, it will be spent undoubtedly. Besides,
had it been spent by individuals, it would have been laid
for the supply of private wants, which are not near so extensive
as those of the public: and farther, when money is so taken
from rich individuals, it obliges them to find out a way of
procuring more, out of their solid property; and when this
facility is not procured for them by their statesman, we see how
taxes become both oppressive and ill paid. On the contrary, when
it is provided, either by the returns of foreign trade, which
greatly augment the coin of a country; or by banks, which melt
down property into paper circulation; we see taxes augmenting
constantly, without creating any impediment to consumption, or
discouragement to industry. All these consequences hang in a
chain, and hence the solidity of the principles upon which they
depend may be gathered.</p>

<p class='c001'>After this solution of the question proposed, let those who are
versed in history combine circumstances, and examine whether
facts do not prove the truth of what I have said.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the time of the Roman empire, when the riches of
Asia flowed into the coffers of Rome, and were constantly exhausted
by the prodigality of the emperors, we perceive, from
many circumstances, to what a degree the consumption of superfluities
augmented. The price of certain commodities rose to
an excessive height; industrious people, of the lowest extraction,
were daily seen to amass prodigious fortunes: these are proofs of
circulation. But when we consider the expences of a Lucullus,
or of a Crassus, who consumed, it is said, the work of ten thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>slaves, and compare the consequence of that consumption with the
expence of a modern, who should consume the industry of ten
thousand freemen, we shall find a wonderful difference in the effects
of the one and of the other, with respect to circulation, and the
encouragement given to industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no alienation between Crassus and his ten thousand
slaves, notwithstanding all the work consumed; consequently,
the only circulation implied by this consumption was in proportion
to the necessaries which the master was obliged to purchase for so
great a multitude: and if we still suppose all those necessaries to
have been produced by their own labour, then the state of Rome
could not, but by an arbitrary imposition laid upon Lucullus and
Crassus, draw one farthing out of their coffers; consequently, industry
could not increase in proportion to the loads of wealth
brought from Asia by those generals. Whereas were Lucullus now
at London, or at Paris, he would not be able to spend a shilling,
without giving a penny, and perhaps more, out of his treasure to
the state, which would immediately throw it back into circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we are now on the subject of circulation among the ancients,
let me briefly trace the progress of it in Europe, through different
modifications, to our own times, and so close this chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the seat of empire was translated to Constantinople, and
all the Asiatic provinces attached to the Emperors of the East, a stop
was put to the augmentation of coin and bullion in the empire of
the West. A considerable part of what had formerly been there
returned to Constantinople, and the remainder fell a prey to the
barbarous nations which overran it. This may be called the first
period.</p>

<p class='c001'>These barbarians, by enslaving all the ancient inhabitants, and
by forcing them to perform every kind of service, must have had
little use for coin. What they coined appears to have been broad
and thin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let any one reflect upon the insensible waste of silver plate, and
the still greater loss on coin which circulates; the vast sums carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>off in the time of the Croisades; the quantities buried or thrown
into rivers in times of devastation; and add to these circumstances,
that from the fifth century after Christ, till the discovery of the
Indies, there was, probably, little or no silver or gold brought into
Europe; and it will appear very natural, that coin should have been
at that time much more scarce than formerly.</p>

<p class='c001'>How contracted circulation was during the 13th and 14th centuries,
may be gathered from the anecdote concerning alienation
in France, mentioned in the third chapter upon public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>But farther, the great subordination established by the feudal
form of government, and the military services to which such numbers
were bound, had the effect of preserving the ancient simplicity
of manners, so unfavourable to industry. The consequence was, that
Princes could raise no taxes; and that all the money the people had
was locked up in their chests. We know there were in those days
abundance of wealthy people; but their wealth inspired them with
no disposition to consume at the expence of ready money.</p>

<p class='c001'>The discovery of the Indies opened a third period, and threw great
riches into the hands of the Spaniards: the house of Austria was
the first enriched, and appeared with great splendor for some time.
Charles V. by his extensive dominions, had an opportunity of distributing
this new gotten treasure among his subjects in Flanders,
his native country: this set industry to work in that quarter. The
Portugueze discovered the East Indies: a new enticement to luxury;
a new motive to become expensive. The Hollanders became a
trading people, and with the money which their industry had drawn
from the magnificent Spaniard, they shook off his yoke. Money
insensibly began to circulate. Princes immediately found, as has
been said in the second book, that it was necessary for them also to
augment their revenue, in order to maintain a proper superiority
over their subjects in point of riches. The increase of circulation
among individuals made it more easy to raise taxes; and the throwing
the amount of them back again, in gratifications to the chief
people of the state, engaged those who came by money in a manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>gratuitously, to expend it as freely as they received it. No
wonder, then, if Princes found it an easy matter to load their subjects.
They were supported in this scheme by the great men of the
state, who found a benefit from it. This revolution has totally
changed the face of affairs in the present period of circulation.
Courts are splendid; armies are numerous; buildings, in cities and
in the country, are magnificent; an old city, compared with a new
one, appears hideous; all public works are carried on with that
solidity which we admire in those of ancient Princes and states,
when nations led into captivity were employed to perform them.
In those days the magnificence of Princes was in proportion to the
groans of their subjects; now they are in proportion to their
wealth and ease. Whence proceeds the difference, the effects are
the same? From good government, and a well regulated political
oeconomy.</p>

<h3 id='ch5.11' class='c013'>CHAP. XI. <br /> <i>Considerations upon Land-Taxes, with some Observations upon those of England and France.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>Of all the kinds of cumulative taxes, that which is properly
imposed upon lands seems the best: that is, it implies the
fewest inconveniences to the persons paying, and to the state in
raising it. That it is an unequal imposition is plain and certain:
this character is unavoidably attached to every species of cumulative
taxes, in one way or other. It has also the effect of casting a
general discredit upon the purchase and improvement of land; because
the proprietors are naturally exposed to augmentations,
which may, almost with the same ease, be carried to the total
amount of the income, as to any proportional part of it. This has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>been mentioned in a former chapter, where the interest of a nation’s
debts was supposed to increase so as to equal the value of all the
land-rents, and the whole revenue of individuals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Land-taxes are imposed in various forms in different countries,
and all are supposed to bear a determinate proportion to the rent.
This, however, is never, nor indeed can it ever be the case. The
value of land is varying perpetually, from the industry of the inhabitants.
Besides this inequality, there are other inconveniences
proceeding from the unequal distribution of property. In Scotland,
for instance, land is divided into large portions; very few small lots
are to be found. The class of farmers, for the most part, labour
the lands of others, who have large possessions. This is less the
case, I believe, in England, and still less in France and in Germany.
A land-tax, therefore, being supposed universal, would, in Scotland,
do little harm: in England, it falls heavier upon the small
proprietors; because the sum exacted bears a greater proportion to
the supposed superfluity of the proprietor. In France, it is still
worse; for there the exemptions of the numerous class of nobles,
and many other circumstances mentioned above, entirely destroy
even the shadow of proportion. It is out of my way to enter into
any long detail upon this head, with respect to different countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall therefore confine myself to a very few observations upon
the method of laying this tax in England; and upon a project which
has been long in agitation in France, to raise their land-tax by way
of tithe upon the fruits.</p>

<p class='c001'>This scheme was first proposed to the late King of France by the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Marechal de Vauban</i></span>, in 1699, and the proposal was renewed some
years ago in a performance called the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Reformateur</i></span>. But as it would
prove hurtful and burdensome to France, in a great degree, from
a circumstance which has not been attended to, the examination of
this system of taxation will serve as a good illustration of this part
of our subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>The land-tax in England has, in my humble opinion, two remarkable
defects. First, The sums imposed at so many shillings in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>the pound<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><sup>[49]</sup></a> upon every district of the kingdom, whether cities,
towns, universities, or open country, even upon the King’s palaces,
inns of court, &amp;c. are not distributed according to any rule of proportion
upon the property of individuals; but this operation is left
to assessors.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. That the assessments, in the annual act for the land-tax, are generally understood
to be at the rate of 1, 2, 3, or 4 shillings in the pound, is true; but it is to be
observed, that no such rate is mentioned in the statute with respect to real estates or land.
The rate of a certain number of shillings in the pound occurs only with regard to personal
property.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, All personal estates, except property in the public funds,
and stock upon land, supposed necessary for agriculture, are charged
in the same proportion as land-rents.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now point out the inconveniences and bad consequences
of these two capital defects.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a tax is imposed at so many shillings in the pound upon the
income of a whole district, every article of the property which produces
it ought to be specified. If this be omitted, there is a legislative
authority vested in those who make the distribution.</p>

<p class='c001'>The articles which compose the whole property, and the revenue
of each article being once determined, the state has it in its power
to impose the tax according to what proportion it thinks fit; of one,
two, or more shillings in the pound. But then, in favour of the
contributors, the different articles which produce the supposed total,
ought either to be specified in the law, or reference should be made
to a book of valuation where they are recorded.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is no easy matter to frame the valuation of all the property of a
country: and it is a scheme I should be very far from proposing,
unless the spirit of a nation took such a turn as to wish for it. But
where a determinate sum has been in use to be levied upon a certain
district, it does not appear so difficult to make a proportional distribution
of it according to equity, and to adhere for the future to
that distribution, considering it as a <em>proportional</em> valuation, if not a
<em>real</em> one. This is done every year, and without it no such tax could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>be raised. But when annual distributions are made, discontents
constantly arise; and the pretended equality thereby observed,
produces worse effects than the inequalities which would follow
from the other scheme: because the change in the relative value of
possessions would then be chiefly owing to the industry of every
proprietor in improving his lot.</p>

<p class='c001'>How valuations in England were made originally I cannot tell<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><sup>[50]</sup></a>;
but in Scotland, it is very certain, that as to lands they were all set
down in a book of valuation at their supposed rents at that time.
So let the sum raised be what it will, every man at least knows that
his proportion must be according to his valuation in the general
register.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f50'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r50'>50</a>. There is no vestige in the history of England, since Dooms-day book, of any regular
valuation being made of all the <em>lands</em> of the kingdom, nor of any tax imposed,
<em>singly</em>, on that branch of property.</p>

<p class='c001'>The subsidies, monthly assessments, and pound rates, in the different stages of the
monarchy, have all been mixed duties; composed of a charge upon the lands, upon
the money and personal estates of the subject, and frequently including a poll-tax, where
qualities, that is rank, were differently charged.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole operation of distributing and raising this duty, has been by commissioners
named by the King, or by parliament, who sometimes upon oath, and sometimes not,
inquired into the extent of every one’s private fortune, and assessed them accordingly.
Whoever wishes to have a more full account of this confused method of raising a land-tax
in England, may consult Davenant’s Ways and Means, Article of Monthly Assessments,
and Aids upon a Pound-rate.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In England, the case is totally different. The proportion every
district is to pay, is indeed recorded by an original distribution made
many years ago in King William’s time. By this it appears what
every city, county, university, &amp;c. is to pay according as the tax is
imposed at one, two, three, or four shillings in the pound. This is
precisely the regulation in France, as shall be more fully observed;
but still such regulations nowise prevent the most grievous inconveniences
which attend this tax; because the burden of it does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>consist in the total amount, so much as in the partial distribution
upon the inhabitants in every subdivision.</p>

<p class='c001'>In England, let me suppose the proportion of the general sum
for a particular district to be ten thousand pounds, at four shillings
in the pound. How is this to be levied as the law stands? Instead
of books of valuation, which shew at least the proportion of every
man’s property, if not the real value of it, assessors are constantly
called in, who examine the rents of all the lands according to the
last leases of them. If they have been improved and let at a higher
rent than formerly, the proportion of the tax is augmented. If
they have not been let, but still remain in the possession of him who
improved them, the tax is not augmented. If the tax be found to
fall too heavy upon the lands and houses, then personal estates are
made to contribute, as is the case in London. All questions or disputes
about the repartition of the tax are determined, without
appeal to the courts of law, by the commissioners appointed for
laying on the tax; as in France they are determined by the Intendant.
Without this regulation all would run into confusion, for
the reason I am now going to mention, and which regards the
second defect in this tax.</p>

<p class='c001'>Any proprietor of lands is entitled, from the words of the statute,
to insist that the whole personal estates of those of the district shall
enter into computation of the total value upon which the sum imposed
is to be assessed. Were such questions to come before a court
of law, where the judges are obliged to determine almost according
to the letter of it, I believe no land-tax could be levied in that kingdom.
But manners, not laws, govern mankind. The spirit of the
English nation is such, as to be incompatible with every thing which
savours of oppression. Hence the few complaints against the
assessors, or those who judge between parties. And as the land-tax
is levied without any complaints, except as to the total amount;
while that remains the case, the fewer the innovations made upon
it are, the better.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>In France, the sum of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span> to be raised upon the kingdom for
the year is determined in the King’s council; and the proportion of
every district (called an <em>Election</em>) is there particularly specified. The
district of an Intendant is called a generality, and comprehends in it
several elections. The Intendant, therefore, makes the distribution
of the general sum imposed upon every election, and upon every
town, village, and parish in it, according to a certain proportion;
and rules are prescribed to the collectors of every parish, concerning
the method of taxing every species of income, every emolument of
industry, even every animal in the possession of those who are subject
to this tax. This proportion is calculated to carry the most
scrupulous attention to every man’s gain, upon all effects belonging
to him, and upon every possibility of making profit by industry.
All this is carried into execution with the greatest seeming equality
in the minute subdivisions.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as the first imposition of the tax is not proportioned to the
actual value of the income it is intended to affect, and as the Intendant
does not set out by a particular valuation of every man’s
possession, before he distributes the tax upon the several parishes,
he is obliged to make up the deficiencies by second and third distributions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span> affects every species of property producing
an income, as well as every kind of industry and employment, it
does not affect every landlord for his rent, so much as every cultivator
under lease, for his supposed profits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Land-rents in France belong, for the most part, to the higher
classes; and these, whether they be well born or not, are exempted
from this tax, providing they be <em>noble</em>; a word which has no reference
to birth, but to certain privileges which any man, who has
money, may acquire.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was in order to avoid this exemption, that the Marechal de
Vauban wanted to substitute a tenth instead of the present <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>;
for a reason we shall presently see.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>All the land-rents, therefore, of the nobles are exempted from the
taille, and are only affected by vingtiemes and dixiemes but when
they cultivate their own lands, their privilege of exemption from
the taille is confined to as much as four ploughs can labour; and
this farming must be carried on by menial servants, unmarried, in
order to prevent such proprietors from defrauding the tax, by really
letting their lands under pretext of holding them in farm.</p>

<p class='c001'>This exemption, as to their land-rents, is more apparent, however,
than real. It is not the <em>lands</em> of the nobles, but the <em>rent</em> paid out
of them which is exempted from the taille; consequently, by imposing
an exorbitant taille upon the lessee, very little remains for the
land-rent; and this tax being laid upon a set of people who are
loaded with many others, is in the end more burdensome to the
proprietor, than if he paid it himself. But a change in this policy
is impracticable. The gentlemen of France will probably never
submit to a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>; and although, by yielding up that point of delicacy,
their rents might be raised in the end; yet as matters stand,
they know they enjoy the rents they have, free of tax, and if once
they were made to pay any part of them, they do not know where
such payments might terminate.</p>

<p class='c001'>To avoid the infinite oppression which results from the French
principle of sharing every man’s profit as soon as he makes it, the
Marechal de Vauban proposed to abolish the taille, as it is paid at
present, together with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>capitation</i></span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>industrie</i></span>, and all the train of
cumulative taxes committed to the management of the Intendants;
and to establish in their room what he called a royal Tenth, meaning
by this term, a proportion of all the fruits of the earth, similar
to what is established in favour of the clergy. This he proposed to
lay on, according to the exigencies of the state, from one twentieth
part to one tenth upon every article of the gross produce of land,
over all France. This he imagined to be equal to one tenth of the
land-rent. And the author of a book published under the title of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Reformateur</i></span>, containing a new plan of taxation, in which there
are some things worthy of observation, follows in this particular the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>Marechal de Vauban, without ever considering the true nature of
a tax of this kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all the taxes upon the income of land-property, the tithe is the
worst; and it has undoubtedly been established among men, before
agriculture or taxes were understood. Lands in all countries are of
different qualities: some are proper for bearing rich crops of grain,
others are indifferent; some produce pasture, others forrest; the revenue
of some consists in wine, in mines, and in a thousand different
productions, which cost, some more, some less expence to cultivate.
The tithe takes without distinction a determinate proportion
of the fruits, in which is comprehended the tithe of all the industry
and expence bestowed to bring them forward. As an example of
this, let me suppose a field of corn, which cannot pay the proprietor
above ¼ of the grain it produces, many I know cannot pay
above ⅕, but let me suppose it ¼: another may pay with ease ⅓;
another even ⅖; the fields about Padoua pay ½; grass fields pay
still more; and rich hay fields will pay in some places ⅔, and
even ¾.</p>

<p class='c001'>How then is it possible there should be any equality in a tax
which carries off, without distinction, a certain proportion of the
fruits, when those fruits bear no determinate proportion at all to
the expence of raising them? But besides the inequality of this tax
among proprietors, I ask how it is possible that any rent should be
determined for lands, which are subject to a <em>variable</em> tithe, sometimes
at <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>, sometimes at <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub> of the produce? Let me demonstrate
the impossibility of such a plan, by an example.</p>

<p class='c001'>I suppose the Marechal’s plan established, and that the tithe to be
imposed is to be deducted from the rent stipulated between master
and tenant. This was his intention: he has in many places declared,
that all tithes were to come out of the land-rent, which indeed
is the only fund upon which a land-tax ought to be established.
And he has as often declared that he never intended this land-tax
should exceed one tenth of the rent, or two shillings in the pound.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>I suppose a field, producing every year 1000 bushels of grain,
to be let: it is to pay a variable tithe, sometimes of 100 bushels,
sometimes of 50, according to the exigencies of the state. I farther
suppose one third of the produce to be equal to what the farmer
can pay the landlord for rent. And I suppose the rent to be paid
in bushels of grain.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to these suppositions, the rent must be 333⅓ bushels
subject to the tithe. Suppose it to be laid on at ⅒, or 100 bushels.
Deduct this from 333⅓, remains to the proprietor 233⅓. The tithe
comes next year to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub>; this makes 50 of deduction, remains to
him 283⅓. So instead of 10 <i>per cent.</i> of his rent, he pays in the
first case 30 <i>per cent.</i> and when at the lowest, he pays <i>15 per cent.</i>
which is thrice as much as the Marechal proposed to take.</p>

<p class='c001'>But how are masters and tenants to reckon with one another?
Lands are not let according to a determinate proportion of increase.
Suppose an estate in lands of different kinds, how is the tithe to
be deducted then? Is the master to take the tenant’s word both for
the quantity and the value of every article he has paid as tithe,
of every field, of every article in his possession, even of the
chickens in his yard? If on the other hand, this variable tithe is to
be thrown upon the possessor, which, indeed, is the only possible
supposition, which way are lands to be let, when we see that the
difference of the imposition, at different times, is no less than
15 <i>per cent.</i> or three shillings in the pound? This, however, would
be the only method for masters and tenants to reckon.</p>

<p class='c001'>But let me suppose another proprietor to let a grass field adjacent
to that which bears grain, and that both were to be of an equal rent,
supposing all tithes out of the way. The gross produce of the grass
would be to the rent, little above the proportion of 4 to 3. Let us
then call the gross produce 1000, as in the other case, ¾ of which
would be 750, for the rent. One tenth of the whole taken from
that would leave the rent at 650, or little above 13½ <i>per cent.</i> deduction
at the highest tithe, and 6¾ <i>per cent.</i> at the lowest.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>What inequality, therefore, would not such an imposition occasion
upon land-rents, and what inextricable difficulties in letting of
grounds? From what has been said, without farther inquiry, we
may declare that no land-tax can possibly be raised, with any equality,
by a royal tithe; and the Marechal has never considered farther,
than how the King could with certainty and ease to himself,
appropriate a portion of the lands in his kingdom, leaving the proprietors
and their tenants to settle accounts the best way they could.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, nothing can make us approve of the Marechal’s,
royal tithe, unless it be the present oppression which proceeds from
the method of levying the taille; by which it happens that in
France few incline to acquire the full property of lands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most of the great estates consist of fee-farm rents. A man of three
thousand a year land estate, covers sometimes with his nominal
property (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominium directum</i></span>) a whole country of fifty parishes; but
the real property (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominium utile</i></span>) of this vast extent is subdivided
into a number of small fees, of which he is only lord paramount;
and what remains is the property of the lower classes, who pay
what is called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Rentes Seignoriales</i></span>, or noble rents, consisting in money
and grain. These rents can nowise be affected by any tithe imposed,
because they bear no proportion to the produce: and supposing
they did, as in some provinces, where they are called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>agriers</i></span>,
(which is the ⅙ or ⅛ sheaf paid to the lord) the tithe, instead of
taking a tenth of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>agrier</i></span>, takes a tenth of the whole crop; consequently,
only one tenth of this sixth or eighth sheaf falls upon
the lord; the tithe of all the rest falls upon the poor proprietor or
lessee, who the more he is industrious is oppressed the more by this
imposition; because it carries off the tenth of his expence and
labour, as well as of the farm which he rents.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the tax which the Marechal de Vauban recommended to
be raised universally over all the land-property of France, when the
tithe was at the highest. To this the late reformer adheres; but
proposes the twentieth instead of the tenth; and after a nice calculation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>of the gross produce of France, he estimates one twentieth part
of it to be worth about 95 millions of livres <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>. Hence
I conclude, that the twentieth part of the income, or one shilling
in the pound of all the revenue of solid property in France, fairly
collected, would not much exceed one third of that sum, or about
30 millions, or 1 333 333<i>l.</i> sterling. This first part, therefore, of
the Marechal’s tithe, imposed at <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub>, would lay a tax equal to three
shillings in the pound on the poor lessees and vassals of the nobles,
while, contrary to his express intention, the whole fee-farm
and noble rents of France, would escape taxation. From this we
may conclude, that no tax upon land-rents can possibly be raised by
way of tithe: as also that when it is taken in kind it is the most
oppressive, the most unequal, and the most discouraging to industry,
that ever was contrived.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Marechal’s principal motive for proposing this mode of
taxation, was to avoid the difficulty of obliging the nobles to pay
the taille. He found also, that there would be great ease in collecting
this revenue for the King, without demanding money of the lower
classes. The consequence, however, would have been, either to
ruin all lessees, if they continued to pay the same rent for the lands
as formerly; or to introduce the greatest inequality imaginable
among proprietors, if the tithe had been totally cast upon their
rents: but as to the method of settling accounts between master
and tenant, in consequence of this tithe, both the Marechal and the
reformer are totally silent.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Marechal’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Dixme royale</i></span>, with all its defects, is a book of great
value, from two considerations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first, that he had all possible access to come at the true state
of the nation. The second, that he wrote with great impartiality,
and with a sincere desire to serve the landed interest, without intending
to hurt that of the King his master. From this book, we have
an opportunity of judging of his notions of taxation; and from the
consequences he himself points out, we discover the miserable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>state of the common people in France, whose situation at this day
is not much changed for the better.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Marechal’s scheme was to reduce the whole revenue of France
under four heads.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first, a general tithe of all the fruits of the earth, without
distinction, which we have already explained.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second, a tithe upon every income whatsoever, even upon
the profits of labour, servants wages, employments, possessions,
and trades of all denominations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third, was a modification of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gabelle</i></span>, or the duty upon salt.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth, which he calls the fixed revenue, was to be composed
of the domain, and several other branches of taxes which he allowed
to subsist, judging them, I suppose, not hurtful to the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now shew wherein the Marechal’s plan of taxation is contrary
to principles, and leave the reader to make his conclusions.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, he has declared in many places, that his intention was only
to impose a tax upon the income of land, which he understands to
be that part which remains after the deduction of all expences of
cultivation &amp;c. in other words, what every one understands by
land-rent, and which, no doubt, is the only proper object of taxation:
but in order to impose upon this part his royal dixme when
at the real tenth, he takes the tenth part of the whole produce, instead
of the tenth part of what goes for the rent; and, as far as I
have been able to discover, he never perceives that there is the
greatest difference between these two quantities.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second article was the tithe of every income, not consisting
of the fruits of the earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where an income arises from a branch of property which can
render it determinate, I shall form no objection to a tithe or two
shillings in the pound upon it. But when he comes to tax lawyers,
attorneys, physicians, &amp;c. according to the value of their
emoluments, I own I cannot find a possibility of preventing abuse
in the collection, or inequality in the imposition of the tax.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>The Marechal’s principal point in view was agreeable to the
standing maxim in France, to make every one contribute according
to his income. Very right, so far as it is possible, without implying
much greater inconveniences than what can be compensated by
this imaginary equality. I call it imaginary, because in the execution
it will be found, that no body will really pay what they
ought, except those whose income cannot be concealed. Whenever
any part can be hid, there must, in my opinion, result a great inequality,
and great oppression, in endeavouring to ascertain it.</p>

<p class='c001'>A short observation will suffice to give a view of his notions with
regard to merchants and trade in general. His intention was to
be very indulgent to this class of inhabitants; and he feels all the
advantages of trade. He proposes, however, to proscribe all notes of
hand payable to bearer, as it is a method of concealing wealth and
exacting interest for money; which he supposes to be contrary to
scripture. Trade would be ill carried on with the Marechal’s
restrictions.</p>

<p class='c001'>When he comes to the lower classes, which he supposes to comprehend
one half of the people, to wit, all tradesmen, manufacturers,
and day-labourers, their wives and children; he takes the
example of a weaver, as a middle term, to judge of the gains of
the tradesmen and manufacturers. He supposes this weaver to
have a wife and family, to work 180 days only (because of the
many holidays, as well as accidental avocations) at 10½<i>d.</i> sterling
a day. This makes his year’s labour worth 7<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> sterling.
Of this he takes 10<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i> for the greatest tithe. Besides this, he
exacts of him for his salt-tax, for four persons in his family, 12<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
So that this man, whose whole labour is only worth 7<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> sterling,
is to pay 1<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 7½<i>d.</i> of cumulative taxes out of it, which is
above ⅐ of the whole fund of his poor subsistence: after which he
adds, “This, in my opinion, is a tax high enough for a weaver,
who has only his two hands to gain his bread with, and who has
house rent, meat and clothes to provide for a family, who frequently
can gain very little for themselves.” To this I must agree.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>I shall give one specimen more of what the Marechal considered
as an ease procured to day-labourers, in their then situation;
which relief, however, they have not hitherto obtained.</p>

<p class='c001'>These he also supposes to work 180 days in the year, at not quite
8¾<i>d.</i> sterling. He values his year’s labour at 6<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> sterling,
and here is the employment of this sum according to the
plan.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have been the more particular upon this part of the plan, because
it gives us a notion of what the Marechal thought a moderate
easy tax laid upon 8 000 000 of inhabitants, to wit, 2 000 000 men
and 6 000 000 women and children, according to his calculation.</p>

<p class='c001'>I come next to the tax he proposed to lay upon salt, of which
mention has been made.</p>

<p class='c001'>This tax is of the nature of an excise, and is called the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gabelle</i></span>,
which we have explained already in a note; and the objections to
it, as the Marechal has proposed them, are no less than three very
material ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, the proportion of the duty is far too great, considering the
value of the commodity. The second is, that being imposed upon
an article of subsistence, it operates immediately on the price of the
salt, and only consequentially on the price of labour. This is no
great objection, were the proportion moderate; because insensibly
the price of labour would rise, were the tax generally and exactly
levied in proportion to the consumption: but this was not the case;
and this circumstance opens the last objection, and the greatest of
all, to wit, that the tax, proportional in its nature, is rendred cumulative,
by being raised at the end of the year, in order to oblige
every one to consume the salt required.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>Now by this mode of levying the tax it loses every advantage,
and becomes an addition to the tithe laid upon the industry of the
consumer. If every man in England were to be rated at the end of
the year, in proportion to the excise of as much beer as he may reasonably
be supposed to consume, would that be an excise? certainly
not. It would be a poll-tax to all intents and purposes, which no
man could draw back.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have little or nothing to object to the fourth article of the Marechal’s
plan. He proposed no essential change, either as to the imposition,
or method of levying the taxes which composed it. The
principal heads of them are,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The royal domain, or the king’s landed estate, together with
all casualties attached to royalty, or feudal superiority; stamp-duties,
and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>controle</i></span> of public acts by notaries.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The customs upon importation and exportation.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, Certain taxes of the purely proportional kind; among which
was one upon tobacco, and one upon liquors drank in public houses
in the country. Here entire liberty is left to the consumers; and
the taxes are principally calculated to affect, or, as he calls it, to
punish luxury, intemperance, and vanity. With this view, he
wittily proposes an imposition upon large and ridiculous wigs,
at that time much in fashion, and upon several other articles of
extravagance.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a short sketch of the Marechal’s system of <em>royal tithe</em>, considered
as to the principles only, upon which the several taxes
were intended to be imposed. The treatise contains several admirable
things; especially with regard to recapitulations of inhabitants,
lands, houses, animals, &amp;c. highly deserving the attention
of the statesman, who intends to execute any plan for national
improvement.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now set before the reader the Marechal’s calculation, as to
the amount of the four articles, when at the lowest, and at the
highest taxation.

<p class='c001'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>minot</i></span> is a measure of capacity equal to three Paris bushels, or the fourth
part of a septier; which is about one half of an English quarter. This makes the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>minot</i></span> to be about an English bushel. The Marechal proposed that this quantity,
when at the lowest price, should be sold for 18 livres, or 1<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i> sterling;
and when at the highest, at 30 livres, 2<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 6½<i>d.</i> from which we may judge of
the exorbitancy of the gabelle, even after all the diminution he thought proper to
make upon it. The French money mentioned in the Marechal’s Dixieme royale, is
here converted into 52¼<i>d.</i> sterling, for the French crown of three livres: because
the silver coin in France, at the time he wrote, was 30 livres 10 sols the marc (Dutot,
chap. 1. art. 6.); and at present it is at 49 livres 16 sols.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In imposing this tax upon the fruits, he allowed no exemptions,
not even in favours of the princes of the blood: for this he
gave an excellent reason. Tithes, said he, were the ancient patrimony
of kings. The Roman emperors and kings of France enjoyed
them. From those duties no noble was exempted. This appears
from the ecclesiastical tithe, which, he alledged, to be nothing but
the royal patrimony, alienated in favour of the church; consequently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>there is nothing derogatory in paying the tithe, although
nothing be more so than paying the taille. So great is the difference
between terms, when the ideas of a nation are connected
with them!</p>

<hr class='c006' />

<h3 id='ch5.12' class='c013'>CHAP. XII. <br /> <i>Miscellaneous Questions relating to Taxes.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>The subjects of credit, debts, and taxes, have been so extensively
treated of in the two last books, that I hope no question
I now can propose will serve for any purpose, but to suggest
the solution of it, so far as it comes under the principles we have
been deducing.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. 1.</span> What is the most proper method for imposing a land
tax?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that according to equity and justice, all impositions
whatsoever ought to fall equally and proportionally on every one,
according to his superfluity; but in land-taxes this equality is not
so essential as in most others. The great hurt arising from inequality
in taxation proceeds from the inequality occasioned thereby
in the competition between the classes of the industrious. When
the same tax affects people of the same class differently, those who
bear the heaviest load gain less, though their industry be equal.
But in land-taxes the case is different: the tax there only diminishes
an income already made, and in fact diminishes the value of
the property; so that were land-taxes made perpetual deductions,
the whole loss of the tax would fall at once upon the actual possessors
at the time it is imposed. Every subsequent purchaser, by
deducting the land-tax out of the rent, would calculate the value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>of the remainder only; and the consequence of the tax would be,
virtually, to transfer a part of the land-property to the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequences of such a change upon property may produce
a variety of new combinations. The state may then sell this portion
of their property; they may with the price received pay off
part of their debts; they may acquire certain districts of the
country, where, being both sovereign and proprietor, they may
abolish taxes, which would then in a great measure affect themselves
only, and establish manufactures for foreign exportation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although an absolute equality in this tax is not so very requisite,
still the inequality ought to be ascertained, and every income intended
to be affected by the tax should be specified in one way or
other. For this purpose, the best method seems to be, to make the
regulation of any one year a rule for the subsequent years, until it
be judged proper to make a new general valuation of every part.
This is a consequence of what has been said: a fluctuating annual
valuation, which is the case in France, produces numberless inconveniences;
and upon the whole, they are far greater than
those which it is intended to avoid.</p>

<p class='c001'>I agree that the same land may be worth more one year than
another; but it is impossible by a fluctuating valuation to ascertain
that difference over a whole country, to the satisfaction of every
one; and although, by fixing it at one rate upon every possession,
inequalities must take place, yet fixing it from rising in proportion
to improvement, will prove an encouragement to industry,
which will greatly overbalance such an inequality. Every one
then will be in the way of acquiring an addition to his income,
free of land-tax; and if this be thought too great an encouragement
to improvement, let the regulation be only fixed for a determinate
time; suppose a century. This is no more than giving
every one a lease as it were of their land-tax for a hundred years;
and experience shews, that without granting long leases it is impossible
that lands should ever be improved.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>Were innovations practicable, according as right reason and
plain principles direct, it is very certain that a land-tax might be
imposed in a better way than I have here suggested. But to what
purpose would it be to lay down schemes beyond the power of execution,
when the principles already deduced so plainly point them
out?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. 2.</span> Which is the best method of levying taxes; by farm,
or by the management of commissioners appointed by the state?</p>

<p class='c001'>The best way to answer this question, is to shew the inconveniences
and advantages of both. The arguments against farming are,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The great fortunes made by the farmers occasion jealousy,
and expose to the eyes of the people a set of men who are become
rich at their expence; hence envy arises, and hatred against government.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, In years of scarcity, war, or public calamity, deductions of
the rent, or annual sums paid by the farmers, are demanded, and
can hardly be refused, and the farmers always overvalue their loss;
here therefore is an unequal bargain: the farmer <em>must</em> gain, the
state <em>may</em> lose.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The people pay less willingly to the farmers than to the
King; magistrates in general support the raising of duties with
more unwillingness, and severities upon delinquents are less easily
born.</p>

<p class='c001'>These inconveniences are avoided in the management. There
men of the best abilities may be entrusted with that employment;
experience shews that many branches of taxation have been carried
to great perfection under management, and men of probity
and capacity will act with as great zeal for the public as for themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principal arguments for farming are; the advantage of
having a fixed and certain revenue to depend on at regular terms;
that the farmers act with more zeal for themselves, and with
greater impartiality in employing under-officers, as well as more
frugality, and therefore can afford to give a higher rent, with considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>profit to themselves, than can be made effectual under the
best management: besides, every one judges himself capable to
administer the King’s affairs, because he finds profit in it; but
people think twice before they undertake to be farmers of a revenue
they do not well understand.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the administration of taxes, it ought to be the object of a
statesman’s attention and care to profit of every advantage attending
the different modes of levying them. It is not sufficient to inquire
into the general consequences of the two modes of administration,
the management and the farming of taxes: those of the
cumulative kind especially, affecting the lower classes, would be
very improper objects of a farm; because it would be in a manner
delivering over the greater part of a people to the rapacity of tax-gatherers.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, the farming of proportional taxes is not
liable to so many inconveniences. The farmers there are principally
employed in watching over those who <em>advance</em> the taxes, and
who are themselves, as has been said, in reality the tax-gatherers
over the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>When therefore circumstances permit, without inconvenience,
the fabrication of exciseable goods to be incorporated with the
farm, this of all others is the best method of levying taxes.
Examples of this are familiar almost every where. The farmers
of the salt and of the tobacco in France are in this situation. In
retailing those commodities, they collect the price they pay for the
composition; that is, for the farm of them. It is not the same of
the aids in France. There the farmer superintends the immediate
tax-gatherer, to wit, the retailer of spirituous liquors, or
of other things subject to the tax. The circumscribing the number
of places where exciseable commodities are fabricated, and the
shutting them up within inclosures, would greatly facilitate the
levying of all excises, whether by farm or by management.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order therefore to decide whether the preference ought to be
given to the management or to the farm, circumstances are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>weighed. When a tax is new, or has been ill managed, or has
fallen, without any visible cause, below what it formerly produced,
or ought to have done; when the amount is unknown, by being
of an extensive collection: in such cases, short farms, and even several
subdivisions of them in a country, may be of use. But when a
tax is well understood, and a good plan of levying it laid down, it
may be well raised, and perhaps better improved, under a management;
as also, when it is of a nature to be easily understood,
and when the very exercise of levying it points out all the frauds
possible to be committed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Davenant, who well understood this question, in his 4th Discourse
upon revenues, recommends farms which are not <em>absolute</em>, but <em>limited</em>,
as the best. By limited, he understands, that the farm should
first be given for a fixed sum; that the farmers should carry on an
open administration, liable to the government’s inspection in every
particular; that in case the profits of the farm should exceed the
rent stipulated, a certain sum should be ascertained for the charge
of management, and the surplus should belong to the King, allowing
a certain poundage to the farmers to animate their diligence<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c017'><sup>[52]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. This plan of Davenant’s was carried into execution in France by Monsieur Silhouëtte,
in 1759.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He very justly observes, that a tax, when farmed, in order to
be improved, will naturally draw, at first, a less rent than the sum
liquidated as a free profit by the former management; because the
farmers will be willing to secure to themselves a good profit; and
next, because they will be obliged to make a considerable advance,
as a security for fulfilling their engagement, which must also be
considered as a deduction out of the produce of the tax.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the advantage therefore in farming must be looked for after
the expiration of the lease; for which reason, the shorter the term
is, the better: three years, it seems, was the common term in England,
in Davenant’s time.</p>

<p class='c001'>All new imposed taxes ought to be raised with the greatest lenity,
not to revolt the minds of the people: the first year’s deficiency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>is well bestowed, if government can but discover the different
ways which may be fallen upon to defraud the tax, and
form a good judgment how far the amount of it may go in time,
when the management is brought to perfection. As long therefore
as a management continues to improve a tax newly laid on, I
should not think of farming it: but when, either from the extent
of the imposition, or the nature of it, frauds begin to multiply,
and management begins to become more and more difficult, then
is the time immediately to put it into farm, either for different
districts of a country, or in sub-farms. If this be delayed, frauds
will daily increase; and the difficulty of preventing them will carry
government to the expedient of imposing penalties, severe in proportion
to the frequency of the crime. Commissioners will constantly
put these in execution with reluctance; the management will become
slack; or if penalties are rigorously exacted, they will become
a handle for oppression; and even though justice be done, and
none but delinquents be punished, yet still the people will be ill
affected with the punishment of an action which in itself they are
too apt not to consider as a crime: whereas in farming, frauds will
be prevented by vigilance more than by fear of punishment; and
this is by far the better expedient. Thus instead of feuds daily
increasing, they will daily diminish, and the tax will improve
yearly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here Davenant well observes, that <em>nothing but divine wisdom can at
first create perfect order; but in all human affairs it must be the work of time,
and the result of much labour and application</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>One good reason for managing a tax before it be farmed, is to
learn the nature of it, and of the frauds it is liable to. When
these are not rightly known, the farmer can more easily surprize
the government, and obtain from it new regulations, under the
pretext of preventing frauds; which regulations they may abuse,
and turn to other purposes than those intended.</p>

<p class='c001'>Davenant has a very good remark, p. 154. That a new tax, imposed
upon consumption, and ill levied, equally raises the price
<span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>upon the consumers, and the whole profit centers in the hands of
those who retail. That when an old excise becomes ill levied, the
profit is divided between the inferior officers (who collect it) and the
retailers. The reason is, that a branch which is well understood,
is not so liable to <em>frauds</em> as to <em>collusion</em>. This shews that in every
case, such a duty should never be imposed without exerting every
endeavour to have it rightly collected. The state should also keep
a watchful eye upon the augmentations made in the price of exciseable
commodities, in order to keep the augmentation justly proportioned
to the duty. If this be neglected, the overcharge hurts
consumption, diminishes the produce of the tax, and enriches the
retailers only. Here competition is necessary to be introduced: the
public may even erect a manufacture which may regulate prices,
and so soon as they are properly ascertained, the selling price may
be fixed by an assize.</p>

<p class='c001'>An ill levied imposition is attended with this additional inconvenience,
that it establishes inequality among the industrious of the
same class; consequently, an unequal competition. This happens
when particular officers are diligent and exact in doing their duty,
while others are remiss. The profits of retailers are <em>high</em> in proportion
to the <em>negligence</em> of the officers of the revenue; and their extraordinary
profits, enable them to undersell and to ruin those who
are exactly looked after: the consequence of this is, to diminish
the number of retailers; to introduce hurtful monopolies; and in
general, to hurt the whole branch of the manufacture. All remissness,
therefore, in collecting an excise, draws along with it a prejudice
to the Prince and his people: and the relative profit, which
balances this loss, falls into the pockets of the fraudulent manufacturer,
and the corrupt and negligent collector. This is not all:
the deficiency must be made up in another way; for taxes must
produce the sums wanted. Thus the remissness in collection occasions
a new additional burden to be laid on the people.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Quest. 3.</span> What is meant by <em>income</em>, when applied to individuals,
and to a state, and what is the nature of the <em>expence</em> which must
diminish it, when it is considered as the object of taxation?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>The great intricacy of this question proceeds from hence, that
what is really an expence to one is the income of the other: so
that without applying our reasoning to every particular fact, no
general explanation can be rendred intelligible. My reason for proposing
it in this place, is, that in commenting upon some passages
of Davenant, in his discourses upon the revenues of England, I
may have an opportunity of illustrating some things which have
been already examined.</p>

<p class='c001'>Davenant was an admirable writer; he had a remarkable genius
for political theory, and his sentiments upon many things are very
generally adopted. My intention here is not to refute opinions,
but to avail myself of his combinations, in order to explain my
own ideas.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his first discourse upon revenues, we find the following
passage.</p>

<p class='c001'>"The number of the people leads us to know what the yearly
<em>income</em> may be from land, and what from mines, houses, and
homesteads, rivers, lakes, meers, ponds, and what from trade,
labour, industry, arts and sciences: for where a nation contains
so many acres of arable land, so many of pasture and meadow,
such a quantity of wood and coppices, forrests, parks and commons,
heaths, moors, mountains, roads, ways, and barren and
waste land; and where the different value of this is computed,
by proper mediums, it is rational to conclude, that such a part of
the people’s expence is maintained from land, &amp;c. and such a
part from mines, houses, &amp;c. and that such a part is maintained
from trade, labour, &amp;c. and the poor exceeding so much the
rich in numbers, the common people are the proper medium by
which we may judge of this expence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is a certain sum requisite to every one for food, raiment,
and other necessaries; as for example, between 7 and 8<i>l.</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per
annum</i></span>; but some expending less, and some more, it may not be
improper to compute, that the mass of mankind, in England,
expend, one with another, near 8<i>l.</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span>: from whence it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>may be concluded, that an <em>annual income of so many millions</em> is needful
for the nourishment of such and such a number of people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The reasoning here takes a wrong turn. It is of no consequence
to compute the value of things consumed without alienation. It is
of no use to know that the value of the physical-necessary of an
Englishman is 8<i>l.</i> a year; because if this sum is supposed to be
an exact quantity of income, no one farthing of tax can be imposed
upon it. So that imposing, for example, 5 <i>per cent.</i> upon this
article would only be raising the physical-necessary to 8<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> which
8s. must be paid, not by the physical-necessarian, but by some body
having superfluity who employs him: and if there was not superfluity
enough in England to answer to 8<i>s.</i> a head, such a tax could
not be levied.</p>

<p class='c001'>He afterwards supposes that the income of this class may amount
to about twenty millions a year, which at 8<i>l.</i> each, answers to two
millions and a half of people. He states the income of lands at fourteen
millions, and the income of trade at ten millions, in all at
forty four millions a year: and hence he concludes, that taxes
ought to be imposed in some proportion to this total.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now if he supposes the first article of twenty millions, arising
from the income of those who are employed in arts and manufactures,
according to the former calculation of 8<i>l.</i> a head, to be as
ready a fund for taxation as the land-rents, we must examine, by
the principles we have deduced, whether there be any ground for
such a supposition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me suppose one of this great class to work a whole day for
his victuals only. Here is an alienation of work for food. It is impossible,
however, to raise a tax in money upon this alienation;
because it may easily be supposed that neither party has a farthing.
The only method therefore, in such a case, to impose a tax, would
be, either to oblige the workman to set apart a portion of his day’s
work for one who would pay the public for the value of it, or to
oblige the person who gives him his food, to pay the public for
the privilege of employing him in his service. The one and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>other are examples of proportional taxes. But this method of taxation
is absolutely unknown. In this example there is an alienation,
which, I have said, constantly implies a superfluity of one kind or
other. The labour of the person working is, here, superfluous to
himself; therefore a part of it may be applied towards the public.
But the bread he receives is in no part superfluous, and therefore
cannot be laid under taxation <em>as to him</em>. But then the bread given
for the labour is superfluous to the person who gives it; and as this
implies that he has a superfluity of bread, the state may demand a
share of that superfluity.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this exposition of the matter it appears, that in order to raise
a tax, in whatever way it be done, some kind of superfluity must
be supposed. It also points out how it should be laid on: for if by
mistaking the proper object, a part of the <em>bread</em> should be taken
from the <em>workman</em>, instead of being taken from the <em>man who employs
him</em>, the tax would affect the physical-necessary of the labourer, instead
of affecting the superfluity of the employer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us next suppose a workman able to do no more than what is
requisite to dig the ground for roots to eat, instead of digging it to
procure bread from a man who has bread to spare; still there will
be no alienation; consequently, no possibility of establishing a
tax: for if you either take a part of his labour, or of his food, you
deprive him equally of his physical-necessary. Yet the work of this
man, and his food, may be valued at so much money; and thus
may enter, in one sense, into Davenant’s general article of income
or expence; but it does not follow that any tax can be raised upon
such an income.</p>

<p class='c001'>To estimate, therefore, the total value, in any nation, of what is
the object of taxation, we must go another way to work. The first
article must be the <em>annual income</em> of all <em>funds</em>. By funds, here, I understand
the capital wealth already made, in opposition to the produce
of industry, which may be considered as the materials of which
such funds are composed. The fund therefore is the accumulation
of savings, which, not having been spent by the industrious, form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>a capital of a nature to produce an income, either from land, or
from any other valuable thing. Thus land-rents, annuities, interest
of money, emoluments  of offices, salaries, even wages of servants,
in short, every fixed income, I range in this first article, which I call
<em>annual income</em>, produced from a capital already formed, either real
or supposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>This may be laid under taxation by a pound-rate, or otherwise,
and forms that kind of tax which I call cumulative and arbitrary;
because a man who has any sort of visible revenue, comes under
this general rate, let him have ever so many necessary deductions
out of it, ever so many debts and incumbrances. From such circumstances,
cumulative taxes frequently turn out extremely burdensome.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second object of taxation is upon alienations made for money.
Whenever we come to dispose of money in the purchase of
any thing, the state has an opportunity of exacting a part of it as a
tax; but while it remains hid, it can neither be come at, or laid
under contribution, without extortion or violence.</p>

<p class='c001'>All branches of expence may be laid under taxation by excises,
which I call <em>proportional taxes</em>; because a man is never subjected to
them, but in proportion to his expence; and his expence ought
naturally to proceed from his income.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for trade, I do not clearly see how the profits of it can be regularly
taxed. In France, indeed, they are taxed under the first head,
and are considered as an income. Such an imposition is not well
judged; because <em>there</em> the materials for making the fund are taxed
as if they were the income of a fund already made. It is only the
savings out of the profits upon trade, placed so as to produce a permanent
revenue, which properly can be considered as a fund: the
<em>income</em> therefore of these savings, and not the savings themselves,
should come under that branch of taxation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Customs are improperly called taxes upon trade. If ill imposed
they stop trade, or render it less profitable, by diminishing the demand
for the goods so taxed; but they take nothing from the profits
already made.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>In a trading nation, the great branches of commerce produce a
certain determinate profit, subject, I allow, to augmentations and
diminutions, from accidents and circumstances impossible to be
foreseen: and the customs imposed upon exportation and <a id='corr588.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='importatation'>importation</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_588.5'><ins class='correction' title='importatation'>importation</ins></a></span>
differ from excises more in the method of levying them than
in any thing else.</p>

<p class='c001'>Davenant, in my opinion, would have given a better idea of the
sum which taxes might have been supposed capable of producing
in England, had he examined the amount of all the branches of revenue,
and of all the species of sale, than in the manner he has done.
These two points known, it would be expedient next to inquire, in
what manner the several articles could be made subject to either
cumulative, or proportional taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>I must now take notice of another passage of Davenant, where
he explains himself upon the question before us: it is in his fifth
discourse upon revenues, where he says,</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>"By annual income, we mean the whole that arises in any
country from land and its product, from foreign trade, and domestic
business, as arts, manufactures, &amp;c. and by annual
expence we understand what is <em>of necessity</em> consumed to cloath and
feed the people, or what is <em>necessary</em> for their defence in time of
war, or for their ornament in time of peace: and where the
annual income exceeds the expence there is superlucration arising,
which may be called wealth or national stock.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The revenue of a government is part of this annual income,
as likewise a part of its expence, and where it bears too large a
proportion with the whole, as in France, the common people
must be miserable and burdened with heavy taxes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>I must comment a little upon this passage.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have no objection to this exposition of the matter; the ideas are
intelligible and clear: but I object against the application of his doctrine
to taxes; because it would lead to error. Here are my reasons:</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Income is called the whole of the earth’s productions: this
I may admit to be just, except when we consider income as an object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>of taxation. But if we retain the same definition to express the
income of one, for example, who labours the soil for his own subsistence,
as well as of another who labours it as a trade, the difference
in paying their taxes out of it will be very great. He who
draws nothing from the ground but his physical-necessary, can be
laid under no taxation; because he has no superfluity. And if he
be obliged either to give a part of his crop in tax, or to sell any
part of it for money to be paid to the public, this diminishes his
physical-necessary, and forces him to starve: whereas the other
who exercises labour as a trade, may be obliged to pay a part of his
surplus by way of tax or rent; and still his physical-necessary may
remain untouched.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is for this reason, that in treating of these matters, I am always
at the greatest pains to point out, that nothing can be the object of
taxation, except what is over and above the physical-necessary of
every one.</p>

<p class='c001'>In all countries where a <em>land-tax</em>, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>steuer</i></span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>, or by whatever
name it goes, is established, care must be taken to prevent the
husbandmen from confining their labour to such a small spot of
ground as is barely sufficient to produce their own physical-necessary,
unless when they have a trade to assist them in paying what
the public demands of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this circumstance, and this only, it happens, that the land-tax
in England is so little burdensome, comparatively to what it is
in many nations of Europe. Lands in England are let in large portions:
no body will let a farm so small as to be proportioned to the
supplying of the mere physical wants of the farmer. But in other
countries, where the oeconomy is different; where inheritances in
land are constantly divided, as moveables, among all the children;
the lots become so small, that the proprietor can draw no more
from them than his own subsistence; and then when a land-tax is
imposed, this poor little portion being valued in proportion to what
it can produce, as well as the greatest estate in land, the husbandman
is starved, although the tax demanded of him be laid on in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>the exact proportion to the produce of his land, while he that has
a surplus is quite easy.</p>

<p class='c001'>I would therefore recommend, in countries where this minute
subdivision of lands has taken place, that for the future none under
a certain extent or value should be suffered to be divided among
the children, but ordered to be sold, and the price divided among
them; and that the same regulation should be observed upon the
death of such proprietors whose lands are not sufficient to produce
three times the physical-necessary of the labourers. This would
engage a people to exercise agriculture as a trade, and to give over
that trifling husbandry which produces no surplus, and which involves
so many poor people in the oppression of land-taxes. This
plan can never be recommended as a plan to be executed all at
once: it must be done by degrees, and in proportion to the progress
of industry. The principle is so evident, that I never found
any one who did not immediately agree to the justness of my observation;
although in imposing land-taxes I have nowhere found
it attended to<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. Some small attention is paid to the poorer sort of landholders in England: for, by
the annual act for a land-tax, no poor person shall be liable to the pound-rate, whose
lands, &amp;c. are not worth 20<i>s.</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per annum</i></span> value.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Here then is the use of theory; it directs us in practice to avoid
difficulties, which might otherwise be judged unsurmountable.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, I farther observe, that it is a more hurtful error still to mistake
the produce of industry for the taxable income arising from
it, than to mistake the gross produce of land for the rent: because
the profits upon industry bear a smaller proportion to its produce,
than the rents of lands do to their full fruits.</p>

<p class='c001'>The best method of raising money upon the lower classes of the
industrious, is rightly to lay their consumption under proportional
taxes, which they may easily draw back; because they will raise
the price of their work proportionally.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we may conclude, contrary to the common opinion,
that the test of well imposed taxes is to raise prices in proportion.
When they are rightly imposed, every one who sells a commodity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>which has paid a tax, will draw it back, whether he be industrious
or not. If he consumes it, he cannot draw it back, but by raising
the price of his work, which again he cannot do, unless the tax
be made so general as to affect all his competitors; and unless the
consumption he has made be unavoidable to every one of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we reflect upon the large quantities of exciseable goods
which are consumed as superfluities, we must conclude that the
rise of prices, daily complained of, proceeds more from our manners
than from the taxes we pay.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The expence of a people is not merely what is sufficient to subsist
them; but what they consume, either in fruits, of manufactures.
Had indeed Davenant computed the value of this necessary quantity,
and deducted it from the income, according to his acceptation
of income; the remainder would have been a tolerable good representation
of what I mean by income, or taxable fund; because
whatever a people consume beyond the necessary, I consider as a
superfluity which may be laid under taxation.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, I must also differ from him in his idea concerning superlucration,
wealth, or national stock.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to him, this is the quantity of income remaining after
the following deductions: 1<i>mo</i>, What is <em>necessary</em> to clothe and feed
the people, 2<i>do</i>, What is <em>necessary</em> for their defence in time of
war, and ornament in time of peace. But according to my notions,
I must also deduct all that is consumed in superfluities; for
what is consumed, whether <em>necessarily</em> or <em>superfluously</em>, never can
make an article of superlucration, wealth, or national stock.</p>

<p class='c001'>The superlucration then of a nation consists in the augmentations
made upon her stock of every kind, capable of producing a
proportional income: it is the converting into something durable
the well employed time of the inhabitants. In this sense the new
pavement of London, the roads, buildings, ships, &amp;c. in England,
are all articles of superlucration, as well as the improvement of
the lands, and consolidation of the balance of her trade, which
has created that part of the public funds belonging to natives.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span><span class='sc'>Quest. 4.</span> Is it possible to convert a land-tax into one of the proportional
kind?</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a curious speculation; and as it is a short exercise upon
several principles of this science, it comes in properly at the conclusion
of our work.</p>

<p class='c001'>To make a land-tax proportional, the proprietors of land should
be enabled to draw back the burden, in the sale of the earth’s productions.
This they cannot do, as matters stand. The farmers
who pay no land-tax undersell them; because they have no tax to
draw back.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since the tax, therefore, cannot be drawn back directly, let us
apply our principles to discover a method how this might be done
indirectly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let nothing but lands be subject to this imposition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let every part of them be valued, and recorded in a general
register.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let bread, butchers-meat, and subsistence of all kinds, be laid
under an excise, <em>in all markets</em>, and nowhere else, at a rate sufficient
to raise the tax intended to be laid upon the lands; and let the
amount of this tax be drawn back by the landlords, in proportion
to the valuation by which they have paid the land-tax.</p>

<p class='c001'>That this is a reasonable imposition, appears from the whole
plan of this work. We have seen, in the first book, how the great
body of the people is divided into labourers and free hands; that
the free hands are the inhabitants of towns, who go to market for
subsistence, and consume what corresponds to the land-rents; consequently
the landlords, who at present pay a cumulative tax,
which they cannot draw back in any shape, are justly intitled to the
amount of this proportional tax, laid upon the great articles which
produce their land-rents, and which are consumed by the inhabitants
not employed in agriculture.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every one who has writ concerning taxes has endeavoured to
contract the object of them as much as possible: more, I imagine,
with a view to ease the public than the people. I have followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>another course. I have been for multiplying the objects of taxation
as much as possible, and for making them more in proportion to
expence than to property or income. But that I may conform myself
in some measure to the ideas of those who have examined the
same subject, I shall propose a tax, which would fill up the place of
every other; and could it be levied, would be the best perhaps ever
thought of.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a tax, at so much <i>per cent.</i> upon the sale of every commodity.</p>

form a jurisprudence peculiar to trade, and to support it by manners

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. II.</span> The object of credit is money lent; the basis of loan
is the payment of interest. If money be wanting, credit will die;
consequently, there must be a method found for augmenting and
diminishing the quantity of money in proportion to the demand
for it. It is augmented, by converting land into paper-money; it is
diminished, by relieving the land of the engagement upon it, and
extinguishing the paper-money. This is no more than a contrivance
for turning into a <em>circulating value</em>, which is the principal
characteristic of <em>money</em>, the obligations of private men, which in
all countries are considered to be of an equal value with any coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>I here explain what is meant by money <em>stagnated</em>, and by money
<em>realized</em>. Money, while it is employed in circulation, can carry no
interest; the moment it lies idle to one man, were it but for a day,
it may be worth interest to another, who willingly pays for the use
of it, when he has occasion either to buy what he wants, or to pay
what he owes. If no body be found who wants it, then it is said
to <em>stagnate</em> in the hands of the proprietors. This denotes that circulation
is full. He therefore desires to <em>realize</em> it; that is, to purchase
with it some kind of income. For this purpose, if it be
coin, he sends it to some place where coin is wanted. If it be
paper, he demands of the debtor in the paper either to give him
an interest for it, or to convert it into coin, which is the money of
the world. Both are called realizing; and in proportion as money
is realized, circulation diminishes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence I conclude, that as the use of circulating money is to
carry on alienation, so the use of stagnated money is to produce an
interest; consequently, a perpetual interest is better than money,
when it is not wanted for the use of circulation. If therefore, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>the policy of a country, the capital of every perpetual interest can
be immediately converted into money for the use of circulation,
the inconvenience of capitals not demandable is removed; because
although you cannot make the debtor pay, you can sell
what he owes you to another, who will; and this equally suits
your convenience.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. III.</span> The simplicity of manners among the primitive
christians, circumscribing very much the uses for money in circulation,
a great quantity of the coin was consequently locked up.
Paper money <em>then</em> was superfluous; because even coin itself so far
exceeded all the uses of their circulation, that it was considered in
the light of jewels and plate with us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taking interest for it, when lent, appeared to them as unreasonable,
as if a lady, in these times, were to ask a price for lending
her jewels to a friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, as money was necessary on many occasions to those
who had none locked up, the Jews, who have always despised
land-property, made a trade of lending; and this drew an odium
upon the practice. I can ascribe it to no other cause. Our manners
are totally changed; and Christians lend money at interest as
well as Jews. Neither trade, industry, or credit, can subsist without
it; and as money cannot be lent, without allowing interest to
be taken, interest is become the basis of the whole system of credit,
and comes to be examined in the following chapters.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. IV.</span> Before industry was established, the calls for money
to borrow were few, and chiefly confined to Princes in time of war,
and prodigal proprietors of land in time of peace. Their demands
were urgent, and the interest they paid was in proportion. The
lenders possessed but a small part of the coin of the country; because
the bulk of the people locked up all they could. Those who
hoarded, would not lend; and this greatly diminished the fund of
borrowing: besides, Princes and prodigals had no sooner spent the
money borrowed, than it fell again into the hands of those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>hoarded; and the lenders found, no doubt, great difficulties in
procuring fresh supplies.</p>

<p class='c001'>When industry and trade brought money out of its repositories,
when the necessity of permitting interest appeared evident to the
church, the coin then began to make its appearance, and was
ready to be lent. This opened a market for money. The price of
money is the rate of interest. At this market, the borrowers and
lenders appear in competition among themselves, according to circumstances.
If more money is demanded to be borrowed than is
offered to be lent, the competition takes place among the borrowers,
and interest rises. If more is offered to be lent than is demanded
to be borrowed, interest falls. Those who borrow money
may be divided into two classes, viz. those who intend to spend
it, and those who intend to trade with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When more money is to be lent than the first class demands, the
rate of interest will be regulated by what merchants <em>can</em> give for it:
when there is less, it will rise to what the prodigals <em>will</em> give
for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this first class must have good credit, or their borrowing
will be cut off. When therefore a statesman finds, that the borrowing
of such people hurts the commercial interest of his country,
by keeping interest high, he should weaken their credit, by
tying up their lands by entails. When their borrowing becomes
necessary for the encouragement of industry, and for bringing all
the money there is into circulation, then their credit should be enlarged,
by promoting an expeditious sale of every branch of their
property.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. V.</span> Thus, without the aid of law, the interest of money
is regulated by demand. But a state must not totally overlook the
interest of the class who spend more than their incomes. It would
be inhuman to throw them into the jaws of usurers. Statutes
therefore prevent interest from rising above a certain rate. This
preserves them, and renders the dissipation of their fortunes more
gradual.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>But although a statesman has it in his power to guard his people
against the oppression of usury, by preventing the rate of money
from rising above the ordinary standard of demand, he cannot
equally force it down below this standard, even although the interests
of trade should require it: because if the monied men can lend
their capitals abroad, at a higher interest than they can procure for
them at home, they will distress the landed interest, by demanding
what they owe, and all the money will be sent abroad, as was the
case in Scotland in 1762.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was not the case a hundred years ago. No money then
could be lent abroad by Englishmen; because those who would
give high interest had no credit. Thus government could bring it
down at will; monied men were forced to consent; and the price
of land rose in proportion as interest fell.</p>

<p class='c001'>As it is the extravagance of men of property which raises the rate
of money above what is consistent with the interest of trade, the
expedients to bring it down, are, 1. To circumscribe borrowing by
the prodigal: 2. To suspend borrowing by the state: and 3. To
throw as much public money as possible into the market, by paying
off debts. When a statesman has by such measures brought the
rate of money considerably below the legal price, he may, by a
new statute, prevent its rising again so high as formerly; but still
he must keep in his eye the rate of money, and state of credit in
rival nations, in order to avoid the inconveniences already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VI.</span> If Great Britain were to regulate the rate of money below
what the fluctuations of demand are commonly found to carry
it, then in time of war, as soon as demand, which can be subject to no
statute, got up to the high standard, the whole landed interest would
be torn to pieces by their creditors: for the debtors could not borrow
from one to pay another, because no man would give them credit.
This would put an end to all their expence; the funds which supply
it at present (the land-rents) would be carried off by creditors;
and all the industrious who serve such proprietors of land would
suffer considerably for want of employment. The conclusion which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>the generality of people would draw from this phænomenon would
be, that high interest, instead of being hurtful, is advantageous to
trade.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VII.</span> Hence we may conclude, that low interest is principally
advantageous for carrying on foreign commerce, and that
the best method to keep it low, is to keep circulation full, by facilitating
the melting down of property.</p>

<p class='c001'>This expedient has been contrived by merchants in the establishment
of banks upon mortgage; and there is a possibility that
landed men, some centuries hence, may find out that they may
imitate the example of traders, and contrive the means of borrowing
cheaper than they can do at present.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were a particular nation to carry such expedients into execution
with success, it would have the effect of bringing down the rate of
money every where. This would sink the general average of the
whole, but never would prevent the operation of those principles
by which it had been brought down; and the most intelligent nations
would still have the same advantages as before, of keeping
their interest low relatively to their neighbours, which is the great <em>desideratum</em>
for the support of public credit, as well as of foreign trade.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VIII.</span> But although it is of very great advantage to trade
to have interest low, we cannot judge of the prosperity of trade
from this circumstance alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>That nation gains the most upon her trade who draws the greatest
balance from the rest of the world. Now the balance cannot be
judged of by the rate of interest; because this depends more upon
manners and policy than upon the state of industry. Industry must
be supported by superior dexterity, natural advantages, and promptitude
of payments, as well as by low interest. Prompt payment
alone, is of more consequence to the industrious populace, than a
small difference upon the rate of interest. That encourages the
whole class of manufacturers. Low interest is principally an advantage
to the merchants who are obliged to employ credit for collecting
their work; and merchants themselves who trade upon credit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>often gain more by quick returns than what will compensate a considerable
difference in the rate of interest. Low interest may more
properly be called the barometer of public credit than of foreign
commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. IX.</span>  From what has been said, I conclude, that the rate of
interest does not sink as wealth increases; because it is influenced
by many circumstances, which do not depend upon opulence. It
depends upon the spirit and manners of a people, and will fluctuate
with them.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Part II.</span> <i>Of Banks.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. I.</span> Having deduced the principles which regulate the
rate of interest, I proceed to investigate those which
influence domestic circulation; and as banks are the great engine by
which circulation is carried on, in tracing the nature of banks we
shall fully understand its policy and principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Banks either circulate notes, or transfer credit written in their
books: the first are called banks of circulation; the latter banks of
deposit.</p>

<p class='c001'>All banks are founded on credit, and according to the nature of
their institution, I may divide the credit they are built on into three
kinds, viz. private, mercantile, and public.</p>

<p class='c001'>Private credit is when the ground of confidence is real property,
pledged for the security of the loan.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mercantile credit is when the cause of confidence is in the trading
stock, abilities, integrity, and good fortune of the person who
obtains it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public credit every one understands. It is when the ground of
confidence is a fund secured by public faith, in favour of the creditors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>for the interest and capital due, which last however is never
exigible from the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Private credit is the most solid of the three; mercantile credit is
the most precarious; and public credit depends entirely upon the
maxims of every government with regard to public faith.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the object of confidence, not the quality of the person obtaining
credit, which determines the nature of the credit. A merchant
may grant bond on the credit of his lands; a landed man’s bill,
as member of a mercantile company, may only affect his stock in
trade, and a Prince may pledge a province for a sum of money.</p>

<p class='c001'>The debts of a state, and the bills of merchants, are more easily
transferred than private securities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Public and mercantile credit stand upon a more precarious bottom
than private security. A suspicion of insolvency will shake the
two former; real insolvency only will destroy the latter.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are some of the peculiarities which characterize the differences
between the three kinds of credit. The justness of the distinctions
I have made appear from them, and from other circumstances
mentioned in this chapter; and the utility of such distinctions
will appear from their application as we proceed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. II.</span> To establish private credit, on the most solid and extensive
bottom, the effects of debtors should be rendred of a ready
conversion into money; the sale of lands should be rendred easy
and expeditious; no entails or cloggs by mortgage and the like,
should be allowed; debts upon possessions ought to be registred,
and those due to banks (the great public debtors) should always
be considered in a most favourable light.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. III.</span> Banks of circulation upon private credit, are of great
use in the infancy of industry. In countries where it is only taking
root, the greatest obstruction it meets with is a scarcity of money.
When money is scarce, payments are ill made; and when the uses
for money increase, if money be not made to augment in proportion,
alienation will cease to go on, and payments will daily be
more precarious. This is so evident that I shall not insist upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>Now as every individual in a state does, less or more, support
industry by consuming its produce, money must be provided for
every one in proportion to the value of his property. This opens at
once the principle of banks upon private credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>He who has money will, every where, willingly lend to every
one who can give good security for it; and the obligation granted
by the borrower is considered by the lender as better to him than
the money he lends. Before the establishment of banks, such loans
were made in coin; but as people discovered that a good obligation
was as good as coin, they discovered also, that when obligations
could be made to circulate, they might supply its place.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this purpose, banks found out an expedient of dividing obligations
secured upon property into small parts of the capital sum;
and by delivering them back to the borrower, with an obligation to
pay them in coin to the bearer on demand, they constituted themselves
debtors to the public for every note. The consequence of this was,
that the coin of the country became less useful in circulation; and
as the banks demanded it, and even gave premiums for obtaining
it, it came into their hands, and served the purpose of changing
notes; that is, of subdividing the sums mentioned in them, into
the lowest denominations of the money of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is not a nation in Europe so ignorant as not to feel the use
of this policy; but there are few who have discovered how to establish
the confidence of the public in this general debtor, the bank.
The reason is, that people imagine a bank should at all times be
able to turn all their paper into coin. Were this possible to be done,
where would be the use of banks? How could they multiply
money?</p>

<p class='c001'>From this short exposition, we may understand the difference between
banks upon private, mercantile, and public credit. The
first lend upon the security of possessions; the second, upon bills of
exchange, which is called discounting; the third, upon the security
of the public funds.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span><span class='sc'>Chap. IV.</span> A scarcity of money only being found to stop the progress
of industry, and thereby to circumscribe the gains of merchants
who supply consumption; and they perceiving that men of
property become bad customers, more from the impossibility of
making payments than for want of an inclination to consume,
joined together, and formed a considerable stock which they exposed
to the eyes of the public. This gave them credit, and every one
who had money to lend was fond of placing it in their hands.
Other people who wanted to borrow, applied to them for money.
Their answer was, we have no coin; but if you want money for
any purpose, we can assist you in credit, if you will give us security
upon your estate. Here is, said they, a note of ours, which any
body will take from you as payment for what you want. This was
the same thing to the man who wanted money for a particular use,
as if they had given him coin; and as such demands became frequent,
the notes were printed, and insensibly banking was established.</p>

<p class='c001'>States perceiving the abuse which might follow, were every one
allowed to issue paper in this manner, judged it proper to erect companies,
who lent them considerable sums as a security for their faith
to the public; and the superior credit of such companies drew the confidence
of the public, and circumscribed the dealings of individuals.
Thus the trade of Lombards, who had formerly supported circulation
by their bills of exchange payable to order, received a farther
extension by the establishment of banks, who, by issuing notes payable
to bearer, rendred them, in all commercial countries, every
bit as useful as any coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Banks once established, regulations became necessary; and of
these the first and fundamental one, was, to issue no notes but upon
good security. If it be asked, what security should be taken? The
answer is, the best those who want credit can give. In a country
where trade and industry are little known, but where a taste for
refinement is taking place, demand must be encouraged, in order
to augment the supply. And as this demand for consumption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>should, naturally, come from men of landed property; the bank,
therefore, should first resolve to issue notes upon the security of that
kind of property.</p>

<p class='c001'>When industry becomes more extended, and when trade becomes
more secure, from the solidity of mercantile funds, banks may then
begin to discount bills of exchange, and as this branch of credit
enlarges, the bank will by degrees participate of the nature of those
secured upon mercantile credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>When public credit, again, is well established, they will lend upon
government securities, pledged in their hands, and thus become
founded upon public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>According therefore to the principal object of their trade, they
are said to stand upon private, mercantile, or public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a proprietor of lands gives his bond to a bank, it should be
understood, that as long as he regularly pays the interest of the
money borrowed, the bank is not to demand the capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this bond they give notes, which are considered as ready money,
and therefore carry no interest. So the profit of the bank is to receive
interest for what they lend, and to pay none for what they owe.</p>

<p class='c001'>What they owe is the paper they issue. They owe this to the
public; and the security which the public has, is the security which
the bank received from the person who borrowed from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence the solidity of banks upon mortgage. Their notes become
money, and this money is secured upon the whole stock of the
bank, and the whole property engaged to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as the stock of the bank is of a determinate value, and as the
notes they issue may very far exceed it, the credit of a bank will
be precarious, unless the value of the securities upon which they
lend, be equal to all the notes in circulation. It will also be precarious
in proportion as the securities themselves are so. Hence the
interest the public has to take care that banks give credit upon nothing
but the best security.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. V.</span> A bank, therefore, which lays down a rule to lend
upon the mortgage of solid property only, would destroy confidence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>if it should launch out in giving credit to those who have no solid
property to pledge.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VI.</span> The use of all banks is to support domestic circulation:
this is two-fold; that carried on by consumers, and that carried
on by traders and manufacturers, who supply consumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>The circulation carried on among the first is in proportion to their
income, and their credit should be in proportion to the funds which
produce it. The circulation carried on by the last is in proportion
to the demand for their industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a bank be established on the credit of solid funds, it is very
plain that they cannot support the circulation of manufacturers and
dealers upon the same terms, or in the same way they do that
of proprietors. They may indeed discount bills; but they cannot
give a permanent credit upon a security which is not founded upon
property. This opens a new combination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Trade and industry are dispersed through many hands, and if
the stock of those who carry them on be compared with what is
necessary for that purpose, it will appear very small. What is deficient
in stock must be made up to them in credit; and this will be
in proportion to their integrity, capacity, and good fortune. A frail
security for paper, which is to become the money of a nation! Such
securities must either be rejected by every bank whatever, or the
whole fabric will tumble into ruin. But this subaltern class of
dealers may have recourse to merchants, whose wealth and funds
are solid and extensive. To these a bank may give credit, and they
again, in their dealings with the other class, may indemnify themselves
of all the risk they run, by profits in proportion to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This class of merchants I call <em>exchangers</em>; because they deal principally
by bills of exchange in the credits they give, which are of
the greatest advantage to an infant trade and a growing industry.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VII.</span> When banks were first established, there was no money
known but coin, and many there still are, who do not clearly
see how money can possibly be made of any thing but metal. The
scarcity of coin raised the rate of interest, and when banks began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>lend their paper, they exacted the same interest as if they had
been lending coin. Hence they were obliged to promise payment
of their notes, in coin, upon demand. In consequence of this, the
policy of circulation proceeds upon the supposition, that bank notes
are equal to coin in every respect; and when any interruption happens
in the ready exchanging them at the bank, all runs into confusion.
I shall afterwards shew how this might be prevented.</p>

<p class='c001'>While a country has a balance of trade, either at par or in her
favour, no body has occasion for coin, except to reduce bank notes
to their lowest denomination of money. But when a balance is
due to other nations which must be paid in gold and silver, every
one who wants coin for that purpose, runs to the banks, which
are obliged to pay in it, and then they are thrown into distress.
Hence we may conclude, that a bank taking upon itself the obligation
of paying in coin, without carrying its policy farther than
the banking trade, cannot stand its ground in a country which
owes, upon an average, a balance to other nations. This opens a
new and a most curious combination.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VIII.</span> In the mechanical operations of trade, when they
are not combined upon principles, and directed by a superior policy,
every balance due from one nation to another upon the whole of
their reciprocal payments, that is, in consequence of their debts
and expences abroad, as well as in the course of their mercantile
operations, must be paid in the metals.</p>

<p class='c001'>For transacting this balance, there is a set of merchants who deal
in the business of exchange. Every debtor to another country is
supposed to have value in his hands for it, which he converts into
bank-paper; with this he buys a bill of exchange, drawn upon the
place where he is debtor, and the exchanger who sells it, demands
coin of the bank, which he sends off for payment of his bills. If
during this operation the bank should stand with its hands across,
and only think of expedients to provide coin, it is evident, that if
specie should totally fail in the country, trade must be at an end,
and the credit of the bank would be undone: for no body will enter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>into every combination necessary to discover the impossibility of
converting the whole paper currency of a nation into gold and
silver. Thus a bank which cannot pay in coin, will be supposed
to be ruined, though in reality it may be worth half the property
of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not then of great consequence to banks, and to a nation, that
the principles of their trade, and the security of their paper, should
be well understood? And is it not wonderful, that they themselves
have not made evident a thing which they must understand far better
than any one who has not had their experience?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. IX.</span> When a country gentleman owes money in town,
beyond what his rents can pay, does he not borrow from some
body who has money? Does not this borrowing prevent his lands
and his houses from being torn to pieces by those who have a right
to demand money of him? Would he not be laughed at, if he were
to delay pledging a part of his property, in order to secure the
whole?</p>

<p class='c001'>The case is just the same with banks. They owe a sum of coin
equal to all the paper they have in circulation. In this they represent
the country gentleman. Foreign nations demand payment
from them in coin; because it is the same thing whether this demand
be made directly on the bank, or on those who can demand
it of the bank. Such nations represent the town. Must not then
the bank borrow upon the credit of the securities pledged at
the time they issued their notes, and which to them represent the
gentleman’s lands? And can they borrow from any but those who
have money? Their own country can have none to lend, while
they owe a balance; they must therefore borrow from other nations,
and transfer what they borrow to their creditors abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence I conclude, that as nations which have coin pay what
they owe with it, and thereby diminish its quantity; so nations
whose money is their land, must pay in land, to the diminution
of that species of property: and as a man who owes a thousand
pounds upon his estate is only proprietor of it for the remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>value; in like manner, a country which pays an annual interest to
other nations, is only proprietor of what remains.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. X.</span> If the country gentleman, who is pushed by his creditors
for money, which he cannot expect to draw from his rents
as they become due, should borrow, for a few weeks, from one
who, after that time, will have occasion for his money himself,
he will be put to all the expence of giving security for it, and
at the end of that short time, he will be at as great a loss as ever
to find money to reimburse the man who had lent it him. This represents
the expedient used by banks to obtain temporary credits,
instead of a permanent loan upon a regular interest.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XI.</span> When trade goes on well, and produces a regular
balance in favour of a country, the trade of banking is easy, and
few employments require less capacity. But when the balance begins
to be unfavourable, and when, in self-defence, they are
obliged to deal in exchange, the case is different.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever balance is due abroad must be paid by the banks, as
has been said, either in coin or in credit. As long as they pay in
coin, the business of paying the balance is left to exchangers, who
conduct the operation. But whenever banks borrow abroad, upon
a permanent loan, and thereby acquire a fund to draw upon, the
business of exchange falls naturally into their hands, and they
may profit of it according to circumstances. In this case, not one
shilling of coin can go out of the country, in the way of payment;
because there will be a loss to any one who sends it away, when he
can pay cheaper by a bill.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XII.</span> But the most complicated combinations arise from
the consequences of a wrong balance on the state of domestic circulation.
I hope this matter will be more easily comprehended,
from the short recapitulation I am now to give of it, after all that
has been said upon the doctrine of taxes, and of the difficulty of
paying them, when money is sent abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Money is the instrument of alienation; and when this instrument
is taken away, alienation must cease. Now, it is a matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>indifference as to circulation, whether money be rendered scarce
by being sent out of the country by the state in time of war, or by
the subjects who owe it to strangers in time of peace. A determinate
quantity of money is requisite for domestic circulation. In
whatever way this comes to be diminished, it is the duty and interest
of banks to fill up the void as fast as possible, by readily furnishing
credit at all times to those who can give security for what
they demand. If banks, by paying balances, shall have exhausted
their fund of coin, the fault is their own. Why did they not in
time provide the necessary funds abroad? But in whatever manner
they pay the balance, the consequence is, to take a sum of money
equal to it out of domestic circulation; and this cannot be replaced
but by more money lent by them upon new securities. If an ill
grounded fear should at such a time engage them to refuse credit,
when demanded, the country will be in a worse situation than if
banks had never been established, from the sudden diminution
of money, which, without that establishment, never could have
happened.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if banks would consider the whole foreign balance as immediately
their own <a id='corr608.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='debt) and'>debt (and</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_608.20'><ins class='correction' title='debt) and'>debt (and</ins></a></span> it is so, when they are obliged to pay
it) they would provide the easiest method of acquitting it: since
none of the expence incurred can fall upon them, in any proportion
to the gain they make, in receiving interest for all they lend,
and in paying none for what they owe within the sphere of their
own circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XIII.</span> Whatever contracts circulation, hurts a bank, and
offers no relief to it with respect to the payment of balances. If
they borrow money at home, they cut off the branch they stand
upon, unless they continue at the same time to give credit to all
who demand to borrow upon good security. This last combination
was omitted in the chapter I am now recapitulating; because of
the multiplicity of those I was obliged to introduce, in order to
demonstrate how hurtful it is for banks voluntarily to diminish
the circulation of the country where they are established. I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>therefore bring it in here, and refer to the chapter for the other
combinations which cannot be abridged.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did banks, upon mortgage, make it a rule to borrow all the
money offered to them, at a small deduction from the common
interest, while at the same time they continued to lend as formerly
to every person of good credit; the consequence in a little
time would be, that they would become the absolute center of all
borrowing and lending, and the greatest part of the expence of
drawing securities would be saved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every person who had money to lend, would lend it to the bank;
and every one who had money to borrow, would borrow it of the
bank. Upon these two operations, the difference of interest paid,
and received, would more than balance the additional expence of
so great a detail. But then indeed some new law would be necessary
to facilitate securities. The clogs laid upon solid property
oblige the bank to insist upon conditions, which put it out of the
power of many persons of good credit to borrow from them. But
I do not propose plans: my aim is confined to principles; and
from those I have mentioned a new clause in bank notes would
arise, viz. to pay in coin, or by a transfer of interest at a determinate
rate, at the option of the bearer, not of the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XIV.</span> This would be an optional clause, very different
from that lately introduced into Scotland, where the option of paying
interest was left to the bank. This has since been wisely suppressed;
because it proved a heavy clog upon circulation, and enabled
the bank to avoid doing what their own interest, and that of
the nation, required of them, viz. the ready payment of all balances
against the country. But in suppressing optional clauses,
government should facilitate the means of paying balances, and
of providing coin. This is done by establishing and supporting
the credit of the banks, in proportion to the solidity and extent of
their funds. An example of this nature occurred in Ireland, in
April 1760, when the parliament interested itself directly in the
support of the credit of some private bankers. A mint also is necessary;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>or if this should be judged improper or superfluous, some
assistance at least should be given in conveying coin from the place
of its fabrication.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XV.</span> All branches of policy are brought to perfection by
degrees, when, instead of being established at once on sound principles,
they introduce themselves mechanically, by custom and
practice only. When therefore a national bank is not found to
answer all the purposes expected from it, private people imitate
their plan, and fill up the void. Thus in Scotland, when the
banks of Edinburgh did not sufficiently support circulation in the
more distant parts of the country, private banking companies
were erected, and degenerated into a great abuse. Every one
issued notes payable to bearer. Thus the public was filled with
paper money, the credit of which was quite unknown to many,
who were however forced to receive it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever is payable to bearer, is payable to the public; and no
doubt the public has a good right to prevent the issuing of notes
by any but such as it has confidence in. When a note is payable
to order, every one who circulates it is responsible for the value;
but when it is payable to bearer, there is no recourse upon any
but the first grantor of the obligation. Such regulations therefore
should be made in this respect as may give a solidity to the paper,
facilitate a general circulation, and prevent the establishment of a
currency confined to particular districts within the same country,
which tends to introduce a course of exchange from one
town to another. This would be the case, were the circulation of
every county carried on by the county bank. A communication,
therefore, of interest between the banks of a country is requisite,
or else the obligation to pay should not be confined to the place
where the bank is established.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XVI.</span> Here I resume the principles I have deduced, in a
short sketch of a general plan of regulations for a bank of circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span><span class='sc'>Chap. XVII.</span> If proper regulations upon the banking trade
should be found inconsistent with the laws and manners of a
people, which require a more extensive liberty to every one to carry
on what commerce he thinks fit, I think it is reasonable that every
company of merchants who issue paper, payable to bearer, without
the sanction of government, should be obliged to subject their
books to some kind of public inspection, that it might be seen whether
the credit they grant to individuals be of a sufficient solidity
to answer for the notes they circulate.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XVIII.</span> The numberless distresses of the Scots banks at
the end of last war, made it necessary to show, in a particular
chapter, what the consequences might have been, had the banks
at that time totally withdrawn their credits, and given up business.
This step would, 1<i>mo</i>, have cut off their whole profits of banking.
2<i>do</i>, It would have ruined the whole class of exchangers; and with
them, 3<i>tio</i>, the whole trade and manufactures of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XIX.</span> Here I take a farther step into those intricate combinations.
I now shew how the whole obligation, both of paying in
coin, and discharging foreign balances, may be taken off from those
who administer a national bank. Their notes are proposed to be
paid by a proportional transfer of interest. All interest due by
banks on that account, and to banks for credit given, is proposed
to be paid in coin at certain terms. Those who have occasion for
coin are to buy it at the mint: but this coin is entirely calculated
for domestic circulation; and therefore a very moderate quantity
of it will be necessary. And for the payment of all sums due to
foreign nations, I lay it upon government, according to the plan
proposed in the 5th chapter, upon exchange.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the whole policy of circulation is divided into three distinct
branches:</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The melting down of property, and keeping circulation
full at all times. This is the business of banks.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The providing of coin is the business of mints.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>3<i>tio</i>, The granting bills on foreign parts, for value in the national
currency, is the business of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XX.</span> The objection to this doctrine is, that if notes are
not payable in coin, they cease to be of value. The answer is short.
The use of paper money is to keep reckonings of value between
people who have property; the use of coin is to avoid giving credit
to people who have none.</p>

<p class='c001'>The value of the paper in the country is ascertained by the value
of the interest which is paid for it in coin; and by not paying the
capitals in coin, you prevent its being carried off without necessity,
whenever a balance becomes due; which balance might be
paid by the means of credit.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXI.</span> I shew, by many arguments, (afterwards employed
in the 10th chapter, upon public credit, and which render this
combination more simple than I should otherwise have been able
to make it in this place) that the return of a favourable balance
of trade will clear the bank of all the foreign debts contracted by it,
for the relief of the country; as a like favourable balance on the
trade of Great Britain has the effect of setting that nation free
from a proportional part of the money due to strangers. In this
case, the favourable balance is incorporated in the public funds
due to natives: in the other case, it is incorporated with the stock
of the bank securities, and enables them to relieve that part of
them which was engaged for the interest paid out of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXII.</span> The constitution of the bank of England differs
essentially in some particulars from that of banks upon mortgage,
and private credit. It is not so much calculated for multiplying
the currency, by melting down private property, as for facilitating
the circulation of the trade of London, and exchequer of Great
Britain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grounds of confidence upon which the notes of this company
stand are very great.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, A capital of eleven millions sterling, for which they are
creditors to the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>2<i>do</i>, A sum of credit-cash at all times in their hand, of about
eleven millions more.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The bills of exchange of all the great merchants of Europe,
which they discount.</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, When they issue paper to government upon the faith of
taxes, or circulate exchequer bills, they have the security of the
public faith for the short advance of a few months.</p>

<p class='c001'>This bank, I have said, is more useful for promoting circulation
than for augmenting it. It has however lent its assistance in
this respect on very critical occasions. It has circulated exchequer
bills; and tallies, which, from discredit at the time, were as ill calculated
to supply the use of money, as lands or houses are, from
their unwieldy nature. The great advantage the public reaped
from such operations, abundantly shew the utility of banks, which
are calculated for that very purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principal operations of this bank are, to receive and pay
away the greatest part of all the national revenue, expences, and
debts; to discount bills of exchange payable at London, and to
supply the country with coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The demand of London for subsistence and manufactures from
the country of England is so great, that the whole amount of
what is sent up to that city, for taxes, and for land-rents there expended
by the proprietors, does not compensate it. From which
it follows, that by the bank’s not giving credit upon private securities,
the whole of their paper is in a manner confined to the capital;
and if any part of that paper casually goes into the country,
it quickly returns, in payment of what would otherwise be
remitted in bills. So that paper circulation in the country of England
is very inconsiderable, when compared with the coin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The intention of this chapter is to examine and compare the
principles of the two species of banking, and to point out their
several consequences as to circulation; from which I am led to
think, that if banks of circulation were to be established in the country
towns of note in England, they would greatly promote industry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>every where, and occasion no inconvenience from their contrast
with the national bank.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXIII.</span> After deducing the principles upon which the solidity
of paper money is established, I proceed to point out the bad
consequences of issuing bank-notes upon a precarious security.
The bank established in France by Mr. Law, and the fatal <a id='corr613.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='catastrope'>catastrophe</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_613.6'><ins class='correction' title='catastrope'>catastrophe</ins></a></span>
it brought upon that nation, furnish excellent matter for illustrating
the doctrine of paper credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>The late King of France left, at his death, a debt upon his kingdom
of 142 millions sterling; the coin being at 28 livres the marc
of silver.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXIV.</span> In a few months after his death, the debt was
reduced to 100 millions, by the turn of a wheel. The coin was
put at 40 livres the marc. But as the hundred millions sterling, <em>in
intrinsic value</em>, after the reduction, contained as many livres in <em>verbal
denomination</em>, as the hundred and forty millions did before, the
greatest inconvenience discovered by the people was confined to
the necessity imposed upon them to sell their old coin at the King’s
price.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this time Law set up his bank, and without doubt assisted
people in that respect, with very great benefit to himself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXV.</span> He divided the capital stock of the bank into 1200
shares, of 5000 livres each (the livre at this time was exactly a
shilling sterling); and the purport of the notes he issued was, that
payment should be made, at all times, in livres of the same intrinsic
value.</p>

<p class='c001'>This bank was established on the principles of the Scots banks,
and lent sums upon every species of good security. The consequence
was, that in less than three years, France, from being in
the most miserable situation for want of money, credit, consumption,
and industry, was raised, as by magic, to the greatest affluence.
The reason was plain: there wanted nothing but an instrument
to set all the inhabitants to work. This Law gave them in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>moment; and their own work was the cause of the affluence which
astonished them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This effect was produced by an inconsiderable sum of notes:
they did not exceed three millions sterling when Law gave up his
bank. But credit and confidence were established by that small
sum; and the notes brought out all the coin which had been formerly
locked up. It is not a great quantity of money, but an
exact proportion of it, according to demand, which supports trade
and industry. That proportion may be sustained by the means
of banks, but by no other expedient whatever.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXVI.</span> Law’s bank was no sooner established, than he
sought to enlarge his bottom. He found a trading company ruined
in their affairs, though intitled to great privileges. He found also
large sums of public state billets circulating at great discredit, from
an ill paid interest. He got a grant of the company to himself
and associates. He opened a subscription for 200,000 shares, of
500 livres each. He took payment in those discredited obligations;
and when he had got the state billets, (given in at subscribing) he
engaged the Regent to promise punctual payment of the interest.
This was no sooner done, than the discredited paper, which was
become an action, or a share, as we have called it, only by being
subscribed for to Mr. Law, rose above par. The nation cried out,
a <em>Miracle</em>! Law was a saviour, in the eyes of some, a conjuror in
the opinion of others.</p>

<p class='c001'>His credit and his capacity for conducting the greatest undertaking
within the power of numbers and computation, being
established, inspired the Duke of Orleans with a scheme of unbounded
ambition, which, in favour of many who have never
rightly comprehended the nature of it, I have been at very great
pains to trace, in the eight following chapters. And as a recapitulation
is useful to assemble ideas within a small compass, which
have been dispersed through many combinations in the work
itself, I shall here, in a few lines, give a general idea of the whole
plan.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>The Regent perceiving the use of paper money, well secured on
solid property, resolved to take the bank into his own hands, in
order to issue paper sufficient to pay off the whole debt of France.
Now paper issued for paying debts is secured upon no fund at all.
It is the same as if it were issued for payment of meat and drink.
The whole security therefore was his own word.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the difficulty was to prevent this paper from instantly returning
upon the bank; because it far exceeded all the uses of circulation,
and, consequently, could not be suspended in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The expedient fallen upon was to raise the value of the
actions of Law’s company, (which by the subsequent incorporation
of new privileges were multiplied beyond 600 000) to a
great height, by promising great dividends upon them. The company
accordingly promised a dividend of 200 livres a year, upon a
capital which was originally worth no more than 500 livres.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great quantity of paper money dispersed had sunk the rate
of interest to 2 <i>per cent.</i> The dividend, therefore, combined with
the rate of interest, carried the market price of the action to
10 000 livres. Here was a new fund provided as an outlet for all
the bank notes paid to the creditors; and in proportion as they
bought the actions from the Regent, or the company, whom I here
consider as the same, the notes were to be cancelled.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this operation all the debts of France were to be converted
into actions of the company of the Indies, and were to share its
fate. But then it must be remembred, that this company had in
a manner the whole revenue of France in farm; and by a recapitulation
of the different branches of their profits, their income
amounted to eighty millions of livres a year. So that if matters
had been well managed, had credit been supported by fair dealing,
had no arbitrary acts of power, in tampering with denominations
of coin and money, taken place, and had the Regent supported
and encouraged the company; they in fact might have been able
to pay more than all that was required of them; and the very diminution
of the interest of the public debts, by the fall of money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>to 2 <i>per cent.</i> was, in effect, cutting off one half of the capital. So
that if we suppose the total value of the 2000 millions of debt equal
to 100 millions sterling, the debts of France, by this scheme, would
have been reduced to an annuity of 2 <i>per cent.</i> on a 100 millions, or
two millions sterling a year paid to the company, who then represented
the creditors of the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the project was too great; the capacity of those who were in
the management was too small, and the time was too short for
bringing about so great a revolution: thus it failed; but in a way
which suggests no reason to believe that it might not have been
supported.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXXIV.</span> The denomination of the paper was reduced to
one half by an act of power: a man who, for example, had a bank
note for 100<i>l.</i> had it reduced to 50<i>l.</i> This at once destroyed the
whole credit of France. But it would have stood its ground, without
doubt, had the Regent called the fifty pounds with which he
paid such a note, one hundred pounds; although, if you abstract
from the interests of debtors and creditors, which never were
attended to, it was absolutely the same thing. The altering the
denomination of paper implies, however, this additional injustice
above that of altering the denomination of coin, that it changes
the value of the paper in all cases; because it contains no other
value than the denomination: whereas coin has a value independent
of that, which no law can alter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXXV.</span> The form of a bank proposed for France, in this
chapter, is pretty much the same with that mentioned in chap. 16;
only here I have not even admitted the payment of the interest in
coin, for fear that an act of power, by carrying off a few thousand
louis d’ors on a present exigency, might totally ruin the credit of
such a bank, and consequently draw ruin on the whole nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This bank is intended merely as an office for keeping accounts
between people of property, and thereby of greatly increasing and
supporting circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span><span class='sc'>Chap. XXXVI.</span> Having dismissed the subject of banks of circulation,
I come next to those of deposit. Here I deduce the principles
upon which the bank of Amsterdam is established.</p>

<p class='c001'>This bank issues no paper, and grants credit upon no security
but coin locked up in their vaults. Consequently, the ground of
their credit is the faithful preservation of this coin. Were it at any
time to be diminished below the value of the credits written in their
books, the nature of the bank would be changed. Were the coin
to be lent on good security, such a bank would then immediately
become a bank of circulation upon mortgage; since it would be
the same as if the credit had been at first granted upon that security.
Were the coin disposed of for no value, the bank would be
from that moment bankrupt in fact, although the secret might be
kept for a long time.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXXVII.</span> The intention of establishing a bank of this
nature at Amsterdam was to fix the seat of trade in that city. The
ordering all bills of exchange to be paid to the bank in coin, and
the giving to the holders of the bills only a credit in bank for the
value, was an effectual means of obliging the proprietors of that
credit to carry on their trade in the place where their funds were
established beyond a possibility of removing them, except by transferring
them to others who, by accepting of the transfer, came
under the same necessity. Were indeed trade to become incompatible
with the situation of the city, as if an earthquake should fill
up the port, then the bank would either be removed elsewhere, or
the credit writ in their books would become of no more value than
gold in an inaccessible mine. This regulation also prevented the circulation
of bad coin; because when payment of bills was made to
the bank, they took care that nothing but good coin should be received.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these regulations it appears that money cannot be multiplied
by banks of deposit; but on the other hand, it cannot be
diminished by exportation, without the act of the bank; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>transfer of credit answers every use of coin in trade, and prevents
also its waste in circulation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXXVIII.</span> Coin is liable to constant vicissitudes. Its denomination
may be changed by an act of power, and its real weight
may be diminished in circulation. But when it is locked up, all
these inconveniences are prevented. Bank money, therefore, being
the value of the coin locked up, is constantly the same: whereas
all coin which circulates is liable to variations; consequently, these
variations are relative to the coin which circulates, and not to the
bank-money. The difference between the one and the other is
called <em>agio</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XXXIX.</span> Many have imagined the treasure of the bank
of Amsterdam to be immense; because no body can ever take any
thing from it, and that it is constantly receiving new augmentations:
but the policy of the bank itself destroys this supposition,
and shews plainly, that the sum locked up never can exceed what
is absolutely necessary for circulating the trade of the city.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true, no person can go to the bank and demand to have the
amount of his written credit paid him in coin. But were the written
credits to exceed the uses found for them, the value of such bank-money
would diminish; consequently, the value of the circulating
coin would increase, which is the same thing. Now as this would
prove a great discredit to the bank, they employ a set of cashiers or
brokers to keep the balance even. Their business is to buy and sell
bank credit with current coin, and to these the bank gives credit.
When there is a demand for bank credit, the cashiers sell it for
coin, and both parties going to the bank, a new credit is written,
or the cashier’s credit is transferred to the buyer. When, on the other
hand, coin is demanded for bank credit, the cashiers pay for it
with coin which the bank lends them; and for their repayment,
they transfer to the bank the credit they have bought with it. This
needs a little explanation. Suppose one to have credit in bank for
a thousand gilders, which he wants to send away in coin. He
goes to the cashier and sells his thousand gilders of bank credit: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>bank lends this thousand gilders to the cashier, and the man who
sells the credit gets the coin, and makes a transfer of the credit in
favour of the cashier. But as he owes this sum to the bank, he
transfers this credit to the bank itself, in payment of the thousand
gilders borrowed; and then the bank may expunge it, if they please,
from their books; because it is due to themselves. Thus although
no money can be demanded of the bank by one who has credit,
they can give the money to a third party who does it for them.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Part III.</span> <i>Of Exchange.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. I.</span> Foreign circulation is carried on by bills of exchange.</p>

<p class='c001'>When reciprocal debts are contracted by different countries, the
creditors in both take payment at home for the bills they draw to
the order of those who pay; and they again indorse the bills to
their creditors abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this contract four parties concur: the domestic and foreign
creditors; the domestic and foreign debtors. This operation can
extend no farther than to the amount of reciprocal and equal debts;
if there be a balance owing upon one side, this balance must be
paid in value, either in money or merchandize. Now as a debt is
much easier discharged by compensation than by payment, merchants
endeavour to profit of this compensation; but as every one
endeavours alike when there is a balance on one side, it operates
upon the whole of the exchange, and every one must bear his share
of the expence of paying it.</p>

<p class='c001'>If London should owe a balance to the world, after compensating
all that the world owes to her, every London-debtor to the world will
wish to compensate; consequently, he will look out for one who is
creditor to the world: but this search betrays the secret, and shews
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>that he is the demander; upon which the other avails himself of
his situation, and refuses to compensate without profit. Hence the
secrecy said to be requisite in this branch of trade. It is requisite to
the trader only, whose interest is concerned; because whatever one
set of merchants in a place wish to conceal, another set have constantly
an interest to divulge. The interest of the state consists in
preserving an equality of profit and loss among them all; and in
facilitating to them the paying and receiving the balances due upon
the total of all their transactions. The loss of the nation is upon
the balance due by the country; the expence of paying the balance,
which is the price of exchange, is only a relative loss to some of
her subjects, and a relative gain to others.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attention, therefore, of a statesman in what regards exchange,
is, 1<i>mo</i>, To take care that the true par between the value
of the national money and the money of other nations, shall be as
much as possible proportional to the quantity of metal contained
in each.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, To remove domestic inconveniences in paying with the metals,
or national coin, every unavoidable balance.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, To hinder the expence of acquitting a small balance from
occasioning a loss on the compensation of reciprocal debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>And, 4<i>to</i>, When he finds an inconvenience in allowing the metals
or coin to go out of the country, he must assist in having the balance
paid in the way of credit.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. II.</span> The best method for determining exactly the true and
intrinsic value of the metals, coin, or money, in which the balance
due to or from a foreign nation, is to be paid, is to compare the
respective value of fine bullion with the respective denominations
of the coin in the two places exchanging; and to state the difference
only, as the price paid for the exchange. To render this
more practicable, a proposal for rendring all mint-weights more
determinate is set forth in a note.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. III.</span> When upon the whole of a nation’s trade with the rest
of the world, a balance is due, it must be paid, either in intrinsic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>value, which totally discharges it, or by giving security for it, and
paying interest until the charge can be obtained. We consider in
this chapter the methods of discharging it.</p>

<p class='c001'>A statesman is the best judge when his people ought to pay with
bullion, and when with credit. If he approves of their paying
with bullion, that is, with gold and silver, he should render the
exportation of the metals as easy as possible. If a duty be laid upon
coinage, he need not be afraid that any one will send off the coin,
as long as bullion can be found; and when this runs short, if he
does not choose that his coin should go out, he must lend his assistance
in paying with credit. If he finds it against his interest either
to pay in one way or in the other, he must put a stop to the
trade which creates the balance: for while such trade is permitted,
he will find it beyond his power to prevent the payment of that
balance in the most hurtful way possible to his country.</p>

<p class='c001'>I here observe, that in countries unacquainted with trade, and in
others where the whole external commerce is carried on by strangers,
a good expedient for cutting off such hurtful branches of
traffic is to lay all the restraints possible on the exportation of the
metals, in order to promote the exportation of what the country
can offer in return. But when trade and industry are established,
these restrictions cease to be useful; because merchants then find
a profit upon exporting domestic productions, which they never
can have upon exporting an intrinsic value.</p>

<p class='c001'>A statesman, therefore, should conduct his operations according
to the situation of his country. If foreign trade be unprofitable,
cut it off as much as possible, and lay every restraint upon the exportation
of coin. If it be profitable, lay no restrictions on payments;
because you are sure you will gain upon the whole. And
if, in any particular case, you incline to keep your coin at home,
mortgage your country, and pay with your credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, when you are obliged to check foreign trade, and lay prohibitions
on the exportation of coin, exchange is found to rise to a
great height against you, yet will this exchange produce no national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>loss: it will be paid within the country by those who consume
foreign commodities, to those who are at the trouble and expence
of transacting the balance.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. IV.</span> Here I demonstrate what before I had in a manner
taken for granted, viz. that the price of exchange is neither a national
loss, or a national gain; but whether it be favourable or unfavourable,
it produces an instability in the profits upon trade, and
should therefore be kept at par by all possible methods. I also
shew how exchange is favourable to exportation, when the balance
is against a country, and how the exchange is unfavourable in that
respect in proportion as the balance is for that country: and as
whatever exchange is gained by exporters is lost by importers, and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>, some have concluded, that an unfavourable balance does
of itself destroy its own pernicious effects, and sets the balance even.
I endeavour to disprove this proposition, by shewing how the importers
are indemnified, as to their loss by the exchange, from the
additional price they get for their foreign commodities at home;
whereas the exporters cannot raise their prices abroad; because
foreign competition will not permit them. So that in one case the
wrong balance hurts the rich consumer at home, who can bear the
loss; and in the other, the right balance hurts the poor manufacturer,
who cannot. Hence I conclude, that it is greatly for the interest
of a trading state to keep exchange, at all times, as nearly at
par as possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>That this is a practicable scheme, I prove by a matter of fact,
and by an experiment made in France by a late minister; where,
upon a certain occasion, the exchange having risen to a great height
against France, he immediately brought it to par, by ordering bills
upon Holland to be furnished at that rate, to those who should demand
them; and by taking upon himself the expence of sending
the money paid for such bills, to the place upon which they were
drawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>I observe, however, that such operations can only be recommended
to statesmen who preside over the interests of flourishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>trading nations; because in proportion as they are benefited by
facilitating the payment of the casual balances due by them from
time to time, in so far is a prodigal nation hurt, by facilitating the
dissipation of their property, and by contriving a ready method of
transferring it to foreigners.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. V.</span> When a nation owes a balance, after all the payments
they have been able to make, either in coin, bullion, bills, or merchandize,
it is evident, that what remains can only be satisfied by
obtaining credit for it, at the expence of mortgaging the country
and paying interest for the remaining balance. When this, however,
happens to be the case, it involves the nation-debtor in a
multitude of expensive operations conducted by exchangers, who
constantly find a profit in carrying them on, though at a very
great loss to individuals within the country. To prevent this
inconvenience, I propose, that the statesman should take upon himself
the obtaining of credit abroad, for the balance due by the
country he governs; and that the expence incurred by this operation
should be defrayed by the public, whereby every individual
within the state will contribute his share towards maintaining an
uniformity in the profits upon trade, and supporting the stability of
commerce, from the regularity of the course of exchange at all
times. This operation resembles very much another of which we
have already spoken in treating of banks of circulation upon mortgage.
There we recommended the payment of foreign balances
as a proper branch of bank administration: here we recommend it
to a statesman to interpose voluntarily between his subjects and their
foreign creditors. This is the best method of supporting commerce,
when it happens accidentally to fall under the discouragement of
an unfavourable balance.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span><span class='sc'>Part IV.</span> <i>Of Public Credit.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Chap. I.</span> The credit of a state resembles, in most things, that
of an individual: they differ however in this, that
when a private man contracts a debt, he himself is answerable for
it. When a state contracts a debt, those who contract the obligation
in the name of the state are not responsible for it. Hence it
happens, that private people are commonly more anxious about
paying their debts than statesmen are who administer for the public.
Another difference is, that public debts do not so much affect
the prosperity of a state as private debts do that of the debtor. The
interest of a private debtor is simple and uncompounded; that of a
state is so complex, that the debts they owe, <em>when due to citizens</em>, are,
on the whole, rather advantageous than burdensome: they produce
a new branch of circulation among individuals, but take
nothing from the general patrimony.</p>

<p class='c001'>In deducing the principles of public credit, we must suppose it
the established maxim in the state to adhere to the faith of their
engagements; and that a permanent fund is appropriated for the
payment of the interest of all the money borrowed: a liberty must
be supposed, at the same time, to redeem the obligation by adequate
payment; and also an easy transfer of the capital from hand
to hand, to indemnify every creditor for the loss of his capital,
which is not demandable from the state, as the case commonly is
in private securities.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence of the swelling of public debts, is, to occasion
a proportional augmentation of contributions out of private property.
The consequence of this again, is, to produce a vibration in
the balance of domestic wealth. This creates a monied interest,
which swells in proportion as public debts increase; and which may
swell to so great a height as to transfer the income of a whole
nation from the nominal proprietors to the public creditors.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>A statesman, therefore, ought carefully to attend to the spirit of
the nation he governs, before he gives way to a regular and systematical
augmentation of public debts. In monarchies, the proprietors
of lands may bear for a while the temporary diminutions
of their annual income, though they will not easily be made to
subscribe to a plan which evidently tends to deprive them of all
they have, and to transfer their power and property to a set of men
whom they have always considered as their inferiors.</p>

<p class='c001'>In monarchies, therefore, a great increase of public debts will
more probably bring on a national bankruptcy, than in governments
which participate of the republican form.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequences, therefore, of the swelling of public debts
may be, either, 1<i>mo</i>, To disturb the tranquillity of the state, by
an attempt to transfer the property of it from the real possessors to
a new created monied interest: or,</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, If a systematical plan of borrowing upon solid security be
not laid down, it may mechanically draw on a general bankruptcy:
or,</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, If debts be allowed to swell beyond due bounds, so as to
hurt the interest of the great body of the proprietors, the state may
be engaged to adopt the fatal expedient of a spunge: or,</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, If the spirit of the people prove compatible with the system
of borrowing and supporting public credit to the utmost extent,
then the whole income of the nation will remain in perpetual fluctuation,
passing from one set of creditors to another, the statesman
still retaining the administration of it for their use: or,</p>

<p class='c001'>5<i>to</i>, If the debts contracted become the property of foreigners,
these will either remove into the country where their funds are, or
the income of the whole will be converted into a foreign tribute.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. II.</span> While public expence was defrayed from treasures,
public credit was a thing unknown. While supplied from rapine
and extortion, it never could exist. During the simplicity of ancient
manners, when there was neither industry or circulation, credit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>was unnecessary: the coin was more than sufficient to serve every
purpose of alienation.</p>

<p class='c001'>When trade and industry began to make a progress in Europe,
in the Hans towns, and in the republics of Genoa and Venice, the
consequences of their credit were soon felt by Princes, who aukwardly
began to imitate their example; first, by borrowing money
upon mortgages of their lands and principalities; and afterwards,
by imposing taxes and selling them for what they could get to a
most rapacious set of men, the tax-gatherers. This spread oppression,
and this again soon brought the Prince to poverty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes, however, once established in this violent method, and
upon urgent occasions, came, in time, to be improved, and formed
a large fund, which now serves as a solid basis for public credit.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. III.</span> While taxes were only appropriated for a time, for
the repayment of the debts contracted by a state, the attention both
of the state and of the lenders was totally fixed upon the discharge
of the capitals: but in proportion as money increased, in consequence
of the whole system of modern political oeconomy, the
lenders formed to themselves a new point of view, viz. the acquisition
of a permanent interest arising from a transferable capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to make <a id='corr627.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='his'>this</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_627.21'><ins class='correction' title='his'>this</ins></a></span> change of policy from borrowing with an
intention to repay the capital, to borrowing with an intention to
pay a perpetual interest, the more sensible, I have traced in this
chapter the progress of the first, by a review of the plan of public
credit in England until the end of the last century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here I analize briefly the sentiments of Dr. Davenant, and compare
them with those established in our days, when the latter policy has
taken place; and upon the whole I determine, that the difference
in the system of public credit then and at present, has proceeded
principally from the difference in the state of circulation, and from
the expedients now fallen upon for increasing the quantity of money,
in proportion to the uses found for it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. IV.</span> I then compare the state of public credit in France,
during the administration of Cardinal de Richlieu, with that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>England after the revolution. Here I endeavour to point out the
influence which the different forms of government have upon the
stability of public credit, both in contracting and in paying off
public debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>In France, the power of the Prince furnishes many expedients
for paying off capitals, which had been borrowed at an exorbitant
interest in times of public distress.</p>

<p class='c001'>In England, the limited power of the crown, and the responsibility
of ministers for their exercise of it, is a great security to those
who lend money to the state; and consequently, proves a very
great advantage in contracting debts upon reasonable terms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The longer the two states subsist, the greater will the advantage
be found in favour of that which adheres the most strictly to the
faith of its public engagements.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the credit of France and England are compared together,
the difference between them is most remarkable. The strict adherence
to the faith of public engagements has established, in
England, so nice and scrupulous a credit, that the smallest deviation
from its principles may prove fatal to the whole system. The
credit of France, on the other hand, has been accustomed to a
rougher usage; and the frequent acts of power, to the prejudice
of creditors, rather occasion a temporary damp than a total destruction
of their credit for the future. Such acts of power, however,
in critical circumstances, prove extremely hurtful; and the
advantage of a well established credit will, in all probability, either
open the eyes of that nation to their own interest, or bring calamities
upon them, which now appear little to be feared, in their
present situation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. V.</span> This chapter contains a short sketch of the plan of
public credit, as carried on in Great Britain, from the end of the
last century, to the conclusion of the peace in 1763. I here enumerate
the principal operations, calculated for enlarging the fund
of British circulation, by engaging the bank of England to turn
into money the discredited bills and tallies of the exchequer. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>have pointed out the principle which circumscribes this power in
the bank within certain limits. I have traced the progress and
fluctuations of the interest of money; which have constantly been
in proportion to the demand for borrowing or lending in the market
at the time. I have mentioned the rise of the sinking fund,
and the use which has been made of it. I have endeavoured to
explain the methods of borrowing by <em>premium</em>, and have pointed
out the inconvenience attending that plan, as long as the principal
view of diminishing a nation’s debt is confined to expedients for
lowering the interest of the capital. I have given a progressive
state of the augmentation of the debts of Great Britain at the end
of every war; to which I have subjoined a short state of the nation
at the last peace.</p>

<p class='c001'>I conclude my chapter, by assigning reasons for the present low
state of public credit in Great Britain; which has been principally
owing to the large sums of borrowed money invested in the funds
before the peace, upon the prospect of a sudden rise in their price,
on the return of public tranquillity. This rise would, undoubtedly,
have happened, had it not been obstructed by the necessity which
the nominal stockholders were put to, of bringing their funds to
market, in order to answer the demands of those from whom they
had borrowed what they had invested in stock: and until this operation
be compleated, that is, until the funds of Great Britain become
vested in the real proprietors of them, the state of public
credit will constantly be undetermined.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VI.</span> Having given a short sketch of the present state of
public credit in England, I endeavour, in this chapter, to extract,
from the best private authorities to which I could have access, a
parallel view of the affairs of France, so far as relates to its revenues,
taxes, and debts, at the peace 1763.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the revenue of France, I here understand, not only what
comes clear and nett into the King’s coffers, but also what is farther
levied upon his people. The parallel therefore will not hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_630'>630</span>between the revenue of France and that of England, as represented
in the preceeding chapter, without attending to this difference.</p>

<p class='c001'>The nett revenue of England charged with all its debts and expence
of government, we have said to amount to 10 213 000<i>l.</i> The
gross revenue of France, on the other hand, appears to amount to
24 740 834<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if from this be deducted that part which never enters the
royal treasure, and which is expended in levying the revenue, and
in appropriations for particular perpetual expences, to the amount
of 6 815 111<i>l.</i> sterling, there will remain of net income, paid into
the King’s coffers, and charged with all the debts and expence of
government, only 17 925 723<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p class='c001'>If from this sum we deduct the total amount of the net revenue
of Great Britain, (10 213 000<i>l.</i> sterling) the remaining sum of
7 712 723<i>l.</i> sterling, will shew the excess of the French revenue
above that of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The foregoing sum of 17 925 723<i>l.</i> sterling, arises from the following
branches:</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Those which compose the King’s ordinary revenue; which,
at the peace 1763, amounted to 12 546 666<i>l.</i> sterling, burdened
with the payment of 2 022 222<i>l.</i> sterling of interest of the debts
charged upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The extraordinary taxes established for a limited time, after
the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. These amount to 2 326 133<i>l.</i> and are
totally appropriated for the payment of capitals, and interest upon
them, incurred during the late wars, according to the principles
of public credit in practice in England, during the reign of
K. William and Q. Anne: and so soon as this fund has cleared
the charges upon it, it is to cease, being no permanent branch of
revenue.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The extraordinary revenue raised on account of the last war.
This amounts to 3 052 923<i>l.</i> sterling, and consists of the second and
third twentieth penny, granted for a very limited time, and appropriated,
as the former branch, for discharging the debts lately contracted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>The sum of these three branches made the total of the
17 925 723<i>l.</i> paid in to the King’s treasury, and burdened with all
the public debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we therefore suppose the two last branches of French revenue
to be continued until all the debts charged upon them are paid,
then we shall find the state of that kingdom reduced to the King’s
ordinary revenue of 12 546 666<i>l.</i>; from which however must be
deduced at least one half of the capitation. This half amounts
to 1 182 222<i>l.</i> sterling, and is so burdensome, that its continuance
will be impossible. The revenue therefore will be reduced to
11 364 444<i>l.</i> sterling, charged with 2 022 454<i>l.</i> sterling, interest of
debts; of which indeed 711 111<i>l.</i> are annuities upon lives, and
must therefore be extinguished in time.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to this view, the revenue of France will be 11 364 444<i>l.</i>
sterling, charged with the annual payment of 2 022 222<i>l.</i> interest
of debts: and the revenue of Great Britain is 10 213 000<i>l.</i> charged
with the annual sum of 4 860 000<i>l.</i> interest of debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>What remains free for France is 9 342 222<i>l.</i> sterling; and for
England, 5 353 000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>But out of this free revenue of France must be deducted the permanent
articles of expence charged upon the ordinary revenue,
exclusive of the interest of debts already deducted. These articles
amount to the sum of 8 468 889<i>l.</i> which being deducted from
9 342 222<i>l.</i> leaves a free balance of no more than 873 333<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, if we suppose the net amount of the revenue
of Great Britain, after paying the interest of its debts, to be, as
above, 5 353 000<i>l.</i>; and if the expence of the current service of the
year, including the civil list, be supposed to amount to 4 800 000<i>l.</i>
sterling, as it nearly did, before the commencement of last war,
there will remain of free balance 533 000<i>l.</i><a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. But if the current annual expence should not exceed 3 600 000<i>l.</i> or 4 400 000<i>l.</i>
including the civil list, which is nearly the present estimate, we may then add
400 000<i>l.</i> to the free balance, and state it at 950 000<i>l.</i> in round numbers.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>From all which we may conclude, that, abstracting from extraordinary
supplies for extraordinary exigencies, the revenue of both
nations is pretty nearly in proportion to their current expence; and,
therefore, their respective powers, when engaged in war, will be
in proportion to their credit at the time.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VII.</span> In comparing the credit of the two nations, two
things enter into consideration. First, the confidence of the world,
in the solidity of their respective public faith. This I take to be
totally in favour of the British nation. The second is, the solidity
and extent of the funds, which are to be provided in security of
the sums to be borrowed upon future emergencies. These resources,
in France, we have seen to consist in their dixiemes, vingtiemes,
double capitation, and extraordinary impositions upon the
clergy, and other bodies politic; taxes so burdensome in their nature,
and so contrary to the spirit of the French nation, that it is
hardly possible they ever can be made so permanent as to answer
any other purpose than a short temporary appropriation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The true resources of France are confined to those taxes upon
consumption above enumerated, which do not enter into the ordinary
revenue, and which are now imposed and appropriated only
for a time. When these taxes become free, they may no doubt be
rendered perpetual, and appropriated for a future fund of credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the side of Great Britain, the case is different. The greatest
part of her revenue is already perpetual; and the only two
branches of annual grants, the land-tax and malt-duty, are not so
excessively burdensome, nor so repugnant to the genius of the
people, as to render the raising of them at all precarious. And
were this nation once to adopt the system of raising money, in
time of peace, sufficient to defray the charges of government, the
sinking fund would prove a resource for the future, far above any
thing that France can boast of.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VIII.</span> Having by this short sketch of the state of credit in
Great Britain and France, prepared a sort of canvass for our farther
reasoning, I proceed to apply principles to some combinations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>which might be formed concerning the consequences of an over-stretched
credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>In proportion as credit is used for borrowing money to be sent
abroad, either a supply of currency must be provided for filling up
the void, or alienation, trade, industry, &amp;c. must suffer a check.</p>

<p class='c001'>And even if money should be borrowed to be spent at home, an
additional quantity of it must be added to circulation; because this
new expence of the state will require it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every fund of property may be converted into money, with the
assistance of credit, providing the statesman lends his hand to the
operation: and the fundamental principle for supporting credit of
all kinds, is, to provide every one with money who has property
to pledge for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When money is borrowed by a state, to be spent abroad, the loan
must either be made in coin, or in paper. If in the first, it is exported;
because coin is the money of the world: if in paper, it
must either be converted into coin, and exported, or it must be remitted
by bills, drawn upon countries, debtors to England, for example;
or, in the last place, it must be paid in the way of credit,
by constituting England debtor to the Continent for it. When it is
paid by bills drawn upon countries, debtors to England, then the
consequence of such a loan is to convert the balance of trade into
a capital in the public funds.</p>

<p class='c001'>In whatever way money is borrowed by a state, whether from
natives, or foreigners, the consequences are the same. The operation
of a favourable balance of trade will transfer what is owing
to foreigners in favour of natives; and a wrong balance of trade
will transfer the property of natives to foreigners.</p>

<p class='c001'>If no check be put to the augmentation of public debts, if they
be allowed constantly to accumulate, and if the spirit of a nation
can patiently submit to the natural consequences of such a plan,
it must end in this, that all property, that is income, will be swallowed
up by taxes; and these will be transferred to the creditors,
the state retaining the administration of the revenue.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>The state, in that case, will always consider those who enjoy the
national income as the body of proprietors. This income will continue
the same, and the real proprietors will pay the taxes imposed;
which may be mortgaged again to a new set of men, who
will retain the denomination of creditors; until by swallowing up
the former, they slip into their places, and become the body of
proprietors in their turn, and thus perpetuate the circle.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. IX.</span> But as a thousand accidents may put an end to public
credit, before such intricate revolutions can be accomplished, the
consequence must be a bankruptcy. This may either happen by a
deliberate act of government, or from the natural consequences
proceeding from an over-stretched credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>I here endeavour to shew, that it is impossible to form a supposition
of circumstances, in which a deliberate act of bankruptcy can be
a prudent measure. The only end that could be proposed to be
attained thereby, would be, to relieve those who are oppressed by
taxes. But a sudden abolition of taxes would have the effect of
ruining the landed interest, as well as all the manufacturing classes.
Sudden revolutions are constantly pernicious; and no revolution
can be so sudden as that of a bankruptcy. If such a revolution
should happen, from circumstances which can neither be
foreseen or prevented, the best expedient would still be, to adhere,
as much as possible, to the faith of public engagements; because
no expedient would be so productive of good consequences, in such
a calamitous situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the debts of a nation are due to its subjects, and while
there remains any balance due in favour of the nation, no increase
of debts can <em>necessarily</em> bring on a bankruptcy. It is a contradiction
to suppose that a nation can become bankrupt to itself. But when,
on the general state of payments between a nation and the world,
there is found an annual balance due, which cannot be compensated
either in the way of payment, or in the way of credit, then
indeed a bankruptcy becomes unavoidable.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span>From this reasoning we may conclude, that the method of determining
the exact extent of public credit, is to keep a watchful eye
upon the increase of debts due to foreigners, and to compare these
with the favourable balance upon the trade of the nation. When
those debts and this balance begin to draw near to an equality, if
part of the capital of the public debts be not immediately paid off,
by an augmentation upon public contributions, the infallible consequence
will be a state-bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. X.</span> The first requisite for contracting public debts, is to
establish a fund for fulfilling public engagements. This procures
the confidence of the lender. The next is, to establish an extensive
plan of credit at home, which may be sufficient at all times
to keep circulation full.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, from the effects of borrowing, too great sums are, from
time to time, drawn out of circulation, the void must speedily be
filled up. If this be neglected, taxes will not be paid, as has been
often observed: besides, if money be allowed to become too scarce,
in proportion to the demand for it, interest will rise, and borrowing
will become proportionally more burdensome to the state in
general.</p>

<p class='c001'>Foreign expence frequently drains the fund of circulation at
home: hence a multitude of inconveniences arise. To prevent
these, I suggest a new scheme of borrowing, by opening
subscriptions in foreign countries where the interest is annually
to be paid. This being to be remitted by the country borrowing,
a statesman may, with the greater ease, obviate the inconveniences
which might arise to circulation from such remittances.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this chapter, I endeavour to prove by new arguments and
illustrations, that national distress is more owing to a scanty circulation,
than to circumscribed property; and a statesman who neglects
to employ every method for keeping up the circulating equivalent
within the state he governs, to the full proportion of all the
uses found for it, fails in the most essential requisite for promoting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>the prosperity of his people, and the establishment of his own
credit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having pointed out the methods of contracting debts, I proceed
to the method of paying them. This may be accomplished in six
different ways, by the help of a sinking fund; which,</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, May be applied annually, to the discharge of certain capitals,
at the option of the state. Or,</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, According to a certain rule, to determine the preference.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, By appropriating the fund, for the payment of a proportional
part of the whole outstanding capital. Or,</p>

<p class='c001'>4<i>to</i>, By reducing the interest of the capitals. Or,</p>

<p class='c001'>5<i>to</i>, By converting the whole of the capitals into determinate
annuities, proportionate to the extent of the sinking fund. Or,</p>

<p class='c001'>6<i>to</i>, By the means of lotteries, where the state may gain what
gamesters are willing to lose.</p>

<p class='c001'>I point out the advantages and inconveniences of every plan.
The first five expedients are too plain to require a recapitulation.
The sixth amounts briefly to a supposition, that the interest of the
public debts is brought, by a proper chain of administration, to a
lower rate than in any other part of Europe. In this situation, accidental
circumstances will occasion (as at present) fluctuations in
the price of the stocks. When they fall below par, let government
open subscriptions for lotteries, to be paid in stock at the
market price. Subscriptions also might be opened, and the old
capitals might be received at the market price, and constituted
a-new at the current interest, with a small premium above the rate
at the time. By such means, the sum of the old capitals would be reduced,
and a small benefit would accrue to the subscribers. Then,
upon the rise of the stocks, the interest on these subscriptions
might be reduced again; from which a double benefit would result;
the price of stocks would be supported on one hand, and the
capitals of the public debts would be reduced on the other.</p>

    <div><i>Of Taxes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Introd.</span> Having already explained the effect of taxes upon
domestic circulation; it now remains to investigate
the principles by which they are to be imposed on their proper
objects.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. I.</span> I divide taxes into proportional, which affect consumption,
or, more properly, what may be called expence; cumulative,
which affect property; and personal, which consist in personal service.
These I explain by giving examples of each.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. II.</span> Proportional taxes may be so imposed as to affect
almost every expence of living; and as all expence should arise
from income, not from stock, the first principle of taxation, is, to
confine all impositions to income only: whatever affects a capital is
oppressive and unjust. But as in all expence there is alienation,
although in all alienation expence is not implied, the best method
to avoid the mistake of taxing stock instead of income, is, to impose
the tax in such a manner as to affect the consumers only; in
which case, whoever buys to sell again will draw the tax completely
back.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. III.</span> In this chapter, I fully explain the operation of drawing
back proportional taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the commodities charged with such taxes are either not
consumed by purchasers, or by the industrious classes, they are
constantly drawn back, except so far as the consumption made by
the latter is an article of superfluity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence I conclude, that the price of <em>labour</em> is raised by proportional
taxes, in proportion to industry only, though the price of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>the <em>commodity taxed</em> be raised in proportion to the tax. Consequently,
the more taxes are found to increase the price of labour, the more
we may conclude in favour of the industry of the manufacturing
classes: and the more they bring into the exchequer, the more we
may conclude in favour of the ease and opulence of those who consume
the objects of such taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. IV.</span> The proper object of cumulative taxes, is the large
possessions of the higher classes of a people, which can bear a diminution
in favour of the state, without danger of encroaching upon
their necessary or easy subsistence. It is not so when they are laid
upon the lower classes; because these are either composed of the
industrious, or of beggars. The first should be enabled to draw
back from the rich, what they advance for the public service. The
latter have nothing to give; to tax them is but adding to their misery,
without relieving the wants of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great advantages of proportional taxes over the cumulative,
may be reduced to three.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, The proportion between the tax and the object taxed is determinate.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, The proportion may be known to every body.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, The time of paying the tax is regular and gradual; because
in paying for the commodity you pay for the tax, and your liberty
in buying such commodities is unrestrained; consequently, the
expence is supposed to be in proportion to what your income can
afford. Whereas in the cumulative taxes, it is, first, hardly possible
to preserve the proportion between the tax and the ease of a person’s
circumstances. In the second place, it is impossible for the
state to ascertain exactly that proportion. And in the last place, the
demand for the tax is made at a time when people are often unprepared.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. V.</span> The principal inconveniences alleged against proportional
taxes, are, 1. That they raise prices: 2. Discourage consumption:
and 3. That they are oppressive and expensive in the collection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>These inconveniences are more apparent than real, as will appear
from what follows.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, A proportional tax, rightly imposed, and properly levied,
will undoubtedly raise the price of the objects taxed; but it will
only consequentially raise the price of the labour of the industrious
man who pays it; because he will draw it back in proportion only
to his diligence and frugality.</p>

<p class='c001'>The price of labour is <em>regulated</em> by demand, and is <em>influenced</em> only
by proportional taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, As to discouraging consumption, if taxes raise prices, this
circumstance proves the increase of consumption; because if consumption
were to diminish, taxes would not be paid, and prices
would fall of course, even to the detriment of the industrious.
These are always the consequences of proportional taxes, when
wrong imposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, As to the expence and oppression in levying them, these
inconveniences are, in a great measure, in proportion to the disposition
of the people to defraud the public: for when they are fairly
paid, and honestly collected, proportional taxes are little more expensive,
and infinitely less oppressive than any other. I conclude
my chapter by some observations drawn from the practice of different
countries, which point out a method of avoiding both the
oppression and the expence of levying proportional taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VI.</span> All taxes are paid out of the circulating money of a
country; consequently, they cannot exceed a certain proportion of
that sum. It is not, therefore, from the value of the property, or
the quantity of consumption, that any one can form a guess of the
probable amount of taxes, so much as from the easy and expeditious
circulation, which facilitates alienation and sale.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were taxes, indeed, paid in kind, they might bear a proportion to
fruits and labour; but then they would diminish the fund of subsistence:
whereas they now draw a share of that quantity of money
which circulates through the hands of every individual.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>The great difference between cumulative and proportional taxes,
consists in this. That in the first, he who pays them cannot draw
them back in proportion to his industry; in the last, he may: but
so far as any one of an industrious class proves idle or extravagant,
every proportional tax will affect his daily profits, as every cumulative
tax will affect the income of a fund already acquired. This
deduction of principles is of great use in imposing taxes; because
it points out the method of giving to many cumulative taxes
usually imposed on the lower classes, all the advantages of those of
the proportional kind.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VII.</span> Taxes ought to be imposed for the benefit of the
public, not of private people: and while that object is fulfilled,
taxes are beneficial in every respect. When they are properly
levied, they only abridge unnecessary private expence: when they
are properly applied by the state, they advance improvement every
where; and those who have fortunes already acquired, will be
brought to contribute to the ease of the lower classes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus by the help of cumulative and proportional taxes, rightly
imposed, and rightly expended, circulation is greatly increased;
industry is advanced; the public good is augmented, not diminished;
and the burden of payments becomes so equally proportioned,
as not to be felt in any degree sufficient to overbalance the
advantages resulting from the general system.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. VIII.</span> Having said that cumulative taxes affect the income
of funds already acquired, I observe, that this income proceeds
from moveable or immoveable property. The first of which will
constantly avoid the grasp of every statesman who attempts to lay
a tax upon it. Cumulative taxes, therefore, if carried to their utmost
extent, may absorb the whole income of <em>immoveable property</em>;
but of that only.</p>

<p class='c001'>Proportional taxes, again, have been said to affect the superfluity
of those who consume the objects of them; consequently, if every
thing which is consumed were first to suffer an alienation for money,
a proportional tax might be imposed upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>The method, therefore, of carrying proportional taxes to their
utmost extent, is, to draw to market every thing consumable; and
insensibly to raise the tax upon it, so high as to absorb, as much as
possible, the whole superfluity of the consumers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes being carried to that height, the state will become proprietors
of the whole income of the immoveable funds, and the
industrious classes alone will augment their wealth, in proportion
to their frugality.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this general principle it appears, that for the establishment
of proportional taxes, consumption is requisite, together with alienation;
consequently, where alienation takes place without consumption,
as in the sale of lands, and other immoveable subjects, a
proportional tax cannot be, properly, imposed. And also where consumption
takes place without alienation, as when the fruits of the
earth are consumed by those who raise them, proportional taxes
cannot, with any propriety, be levied. Farther,</p>

<p class='c001'>As taxes do not bear a proportion to effects, but to circulation, it
follows, that they can only be raised, properly, upon alienation by
sale. Many examples however may be found of proportional taxes,
imposed in different countries, where neither sale or even alienation
takes place. These I observe to be the worst kind of proportional
taxes, and the most oppressive to those who pay them.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the principle that taxes are in proportion to circulation, and
not in proportion to consumption, we discover the reason why of
old they were so difficult to be raised. Consumption then went on
as now, in many respects, in proportion to the number of inhabitants;
but circulation, that is, alienation by sale, bore no proportion
to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The effect of every increase in circulation is to swell the amount
of taxes; and when they are extensively imposed in a country of
industry, the whole currency is thereby made to flow through the
coffers of the public, as the blood of the human body flows through
the heart, and is by that diffused through every member.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span><span class='sc'>Chap. IX.</span> I next examine the consequences of a total abolition
of taxes, the better to discover the effects which such an alteration
would produce, first, upon the prosperity of the whole community;
and next, upon that of the principal classes of inhabitants, which
compose it. These I reduce to three.</p>

<p class='c001'>1<i>mo</i>, Those who administer government, and who are maintained
from the amount of taxes.</p>

<p class='c001'>An abolition of them, with respect to this numerous class, would
draw consequences along with it, directly destructive to their interest;
and, consequently, prejudicial to that of all the industrious
classes who supply their consumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>2<i>do</i>, With respect to the second class, which I suppose to be composed
of the industrious part of the people, I observe, that an
abolition of taxes must proportionally imply a diminution of circulation;
this would produce a proportional diminution upon
alienation; consequently, would interrupt the industry of many,
and thereby throw them into a hurtful competition among themselves
for subsistence. And as it has been proved, that the industrious
classes pay no taxes, as matters stand, providing they be diligent
and frugal, they consequently would <em>gain</em> nothing, and must <em>lose</em>
a great deal by the abolition of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>3<i>tio</i>, In the third class I comprehend those whom we have hitherto
considered as the opulent and idle consumers. Of this category the
proprietors of land form a considerable branch. They, we have
said, draw back no part, either of the cumulative or proportional
taxes, which affect them; but although they be deprived of that
immediate indemnification, competent to the industrious, they
reap, in another way, advantages which more than compensate all
the burden laid upon them. These proceed from the consequences
of that spirit of industry which is diffused over the whole people;
in consequence of which, their lands are improved, the produce of
them is readily disposed of, and what proves superfluous for domestic
consumption meets with a ready market abroad, and thereby
supports the value of all productions within the country.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>It may be asked, then, where the burden of taxes falls, since
every class of inhabitants seems to gain some advantage by them?</p>

<p class='c001'>I answer, that they imply no burden when rightly imposed. The
augmentation of industry, in consequence of the increase of circulation,
provides a fund of well employed time, which, converted
into money, is more than sufficient to pay all the taxes not immediately
affecting the income of solid property; and the constant
improvement of this, in consequence of the former, is more than
sufficient to indemnify the land-proprietors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taxes, in this light, resemble the expence laid out upon new
establishments for improvement; because in their consequences
they augment the prosperity and ease of the whole people, not by
being levied, but by being properly applied, as is farther explained
in the next chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. X.</span> Here I examine whether taxes be a spur to industry, as
some pretend.</p>

<p class='c001'>The doubt concerning this point has arisen from what daily experience
has shewn, that nations become industrious in proportion
to the taxes they pay. It is not very evident, that the <em>payment</em>
of a tax by any person should enable him to discharge it with more
facility, unless it be from the profit he reaps in drawing it back
from others, with an additional profit to himself. But it is palpable
that the amount of taxes being properly <em>expended</em> by a state,
will increase circulation, and give fresh encouragements to industry
of every kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>I close this chapter with a short representation of the nature of
ancient and modern circulation, accompanied with observations
upon their respective effects in rendring mankind industrious.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XI.</span> Of all cumulative taxes, that laid upon land-property
produces the greatest amount, with the least oppression to the contributors.
This leads me into a particular inquiry into the nature
of the land-tax, as it is established in Great Britain, and in France.</p>

<p class='c001'>To render a land-tax equal and easily born, the imposition ought
to be preceeded by a fair valuation of every article of revenue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>intended to be taxed, and no other income but that proceeding from
an immoveable fund of property, ought to be affected by it. From
this I am led to disapprove of the method of assessment established
in England by the land-tax; and also of blending a tax upon solid
property, with an equal imposition upon personal estates, which we
have shewn to be of a nature incompatible with cumulative taxation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The defects of this kind of imposition in France (where it is called
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>) are different. There the rents of lands, which are the
proper object of every land-tax, are frequently withdrawn from
under the influence of it, in consequence of the privileges enjoyed
by the higher classes, which are exempted from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>taille</i></span>. The consequence
is, that the French land-tax falls upon that part of the
lower classes who are employed in the cultivation of the soil. From
this proceeds a double inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c001'>If those who cultivate are proprietors, their portions are, commonly,
very small, and a land-tax which would be light to a considerable
proprietor, is quite intolerable to those who draw little
more from their portion than what is necessary for their own subsistence.
If those who cultivate are lessees to the more considerable
proprietors, the burden falls upon them independently of the land-rent,
which ought naturally to bear it.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a proof that this is a true representation of the matter, I review
the Marechal de Vauban’s scheme for new modelling the
system of French taxation: and from the intolerable oppression
which would follow the execution of it, we may judge of the present
state of taxes in a nation where that scheme was intended as a
considerable alleviation of their burden.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing but the establishment of industry and extensive credit,
with a substitution of proportional taxes, instead of the many cumulative
ones, imposed on the lower classes in France, can ever produce
a facility in paying the considerable impositions laid upon that
nation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Chap. XII.</span> The most proper method of imposing a land-tax is,
without doubt, to confine the imposition to the rent of lands only,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>and to lay it on in proportion to them. But how is it to be expected
that ever such a plan can take place in a nation where the proprietors
of land govern the state? In France, the power of the King
has never been able to establish a tax upon the rent of lands, for
any longer duration than that of a foreign war. In a neighbouring
nation, it has now been established for the greatest part of a century.
Were it there to become perpetual, it might be converted
into a new domain, or it might prove a fund for discharging, at
once, a very great part of the national debt.</p>

<p class='c001'>When taxes are imposed, it is of great consequence to establish
a right administration of them. The easiest method for a state, is
to give them in farm; and this was the general practice every
where, on the first establishment of taxes. But here no general
rule can be laid down.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cumulative taxes are better administred by commissioners, than
let out in farm. The operation of levying them is simple; but
when they are farmed, the lower classes of the people are apt to
be oppressed. When farms are properly established, an open management
of them is absolutely requisite: from this new improvements
naturally arise, which give to the farm almost every advantage
of the management by commissioners. This improvement
is, to divide the profits upon the farm between the state and the
farmers: a plan put in execution in France not many years ago.</p>

<p class='c001'>No question whatever appears more difficult to resolve, than that
of ascertaining the fund out of which taxes ought to be paid.
Through the whole course of this inquiry, I have endeavoured to
shew, that the real fund of taxes is the money circulating among
the inhabitants, either in consequence of sale, or of payments. In
order to expose this question in a new light, I have commented
upon two passages of Davenant, where he estimates this fund from
the quantity of national consumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this he is led to compute the yearly taxable expence of
every man in England at 8<i>l.</i> sterling; when perhaps the circulation
of money through the hands of many may not be twenty shillings:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>whereas, according to my theory, it is these twenty shillings
only that can be laid under any taxation whatever.</p>

<p class='c001'>I thought this method of comparing the result of Davenant’s
reasoning with mine, might better serve to support the latter than
any other I could contrive.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last question proposed in this chapter is no more than a hint
to shew, that a proportional tax, laid upon meat and drink, is the
most proper equivalent for a land-tax; because those who purchase
their subsistence with money are, according to the principles of the
first book, those who consume that part of the fruits of the earth
which is equivalent to the land rent. If this be arbitrarily laid
under an imposition, by a pound rate, or otherwise, the proper
drawback, if any be allowed, should be from a tax laid upon those
who consume that part of the earth’s produce which belongs to
the landlords.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have now concluded this inquiry, according to the plan I at
first proposed. It is the fruit of eighteen years close, though agreeable
application; interrupted only by many intervals of bad health,
and many strokes of adverse fortune.</p>

<p class='c001'>It never was, till lately, my intention to offer to the public,
during my life, what I had composed purely for my own instruction
and amusement. But upon comparing my sentiments in several
points with those of the generality of my friends, they have
been found so widely different, that I was thought in duty bound
to my country, to submit them to the criticism of the public.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this I have the more willingly submitted, as I thereby shall
pursue my first intention in taking my pen; which was, to clear
up my ideas on this subject. And since I can now draw no farther
<a id='corr646.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='knowlege'>knowledge</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_646.29'><ins class='correction' title='knowlege'>knowledge</ins></a></span> from my own inquiries, I must expect it from the criticisms
of those who may think it worth their while to animadvert
upon my notions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Index covers both Volumes of this work.  Volume I is also
available from <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60411'>Project Gutenberg</a>.
Links to Volume II are not underlined. The external links to
Volume I are underlined, and will open the HTML file at Project Gutenberg.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last numbered page is p. 646.  It is followed by a large table, and the
index, which are not paginated. These have been assigned page numbers,
continuing from ‘646’ for ease of reference here. The Index was printed
in two columns, but is given here in a single column.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several long accounting tables employ ‘Carry over’ and ‘Brought over’ lines
to bridge page breaks.  These are no longer required, and have been removed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Spelling, generally, is not ‘corrected’, given the age of the text, unless
there is a clear preponderance of an alternate more standard spelling.
‘Knowledge’ appears three times as ‘knowlege’, but more than twenty
times as ‘knowledge’. Verbs ending with -er (‘enter’, ‘render’) are frequently
spelled without the ‘e’ when used in other tenses, as ‘entred’, ‘rendring’, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>The word ‘Missisippi’ appears as the modern variant ‘Mississippi’
in the table of contents and index. The two instances (pp. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>, <a href='#Page_261'>261</a>)
in the text proper have been retained.</p>

<p class='c001'>Diacritical marks in non-English languages are frequently missing, and

    <div>Indexing Issues</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No attempt was made to validate all the references in the Index. Several
issues did arise during the preparation of this transcription:</p>

<p class='c001'>The entry for ‘Remuage’ is corrupt, indicating a note
on p ‘50?’. The note now appears as note 46 on p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The entry for ‘Ustensil’ misspells the word ‘Ustencil’, and transposes
the last digits of the correct page number (‘496’) as ‘469’.</p>
<hr class='c037' />

<p class='c001'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.
The following issues should be noted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The changes requested in the Errata table above have also been made, and
are marked with an asterisk. The brackets show the specific change made
to the line. The editor’s final request</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
